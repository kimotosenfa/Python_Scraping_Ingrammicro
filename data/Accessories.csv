Corsair,Dual SSD Mounting Bracket,Accessories,CSSD-BRKT2,843591069076.0,7.75,1.0,"Corsair Mounting Bracket for Hard Disk Drive - Black - Anodized Aluminum - Black
The SSD mounting bracket that solves two problems at once
The Corsair Dual SSD Mounting Bracket solves the problem of upgrading desktop PCs which only have 3.5"" hard drive bays. Installation is straightforward: place one or two SSDs into the bracket with the screws provided, and then attach the bracket to any standard 3.5"" drive bay. The black anodized aluminum looks great in any case, and it's designed to allow extra clearance for connecting SATA data cables without straining the connectors.

The ability to stack two SSDs in the same bracket gives you additional flexibility. Even if you have just one available 3.5"" drive bay, you're not limited to a single solid-state drive. The adjustable mounting points support both symmetrical and asymmetrical dual SSD mounting, and it works with both 7mm and 9.5mm height SSDs.

Bluetooth headset designed for the open office with exceptional sound, flip-to-mute mic and Qi wireless charging
ELEVATE YOUR OPEN OFFICE EXPERIENCE
Open workspaces are great for collaboration, but they can also be noisy. Take control of your acoustic environment with Zone Wireless, the Bluetooth® headset specifically designed for busy workspaces. Equally awesome for talking and music. Connects to smartphone and computer simultaneously and features simple controls, flip-to-mute mic and Qi charging.

Zone Wireless Plus can connect up to six Logitech Unifying™ wireless peripherals through a single USB Unifying + Audio receiver.
GET FOCUSED. STAY FOCUSED.
Open workspaces are great for collaboration, but not so great when the conversations around you make it hard to concentrate. With active noise cancellation that reduces unwanted ambient sound, a Zone Wireless headset can help you focus on the task at hand and get more stuff done. Think of it as a personal portal to acoustic serenity amidst a sea of otherwise distracting noise. Same workspace, but with a sound experience that you control.
GREAT FOR MUSIC AND TALKING
Treat yourself to immersive sound when listening to music. Logitech audio engineers have been fine-tuning headset audio for decades, and the results are amazingly clear when you experience your own music with Zone Wireless. For phone chats and conference calls, the noise-canceling mic isolates your voice from the noise around you for clearer conversations and a sidetone control helps you modulate the volume of your voice to just the right level.
SIMPLE CONTROLS. EASY TO USE.
Zone Wireless provides an intuitive and simple interface to adjust volume, play/pause music, and start/end calls. The mic boom features a flip-to-mute function, plus button controls provide easy access to power, active noise cancellation, and wireless Bluetooth pairing. Zone Wireless supports wireless Qi charging and includes a mobile companion app that supports easy setup and simple control for headset functions like sidetone modulation and EQ presets.
ALL-DAY COMFORT
Zone Wireless is designed for office use all day, every day. The silicone-padded headband is lightweight and provides just the right clamping force for a fit that's so comfortable you might forget you're wearing a high-performance headset. Soft leatherette ear pads are cushiony and breathable, so your ears don't get hot. Zone Wireless blocks sound from the moment you put it on, and the foldable design makes it handy to stow when you take the headset off.
CONNECT MULTIPLE DEVICES
Designed for mobile workers, Zone Wireless provides the versatility to wirelessly connect to your computer, tablet, and smartphone simultaneously and seamlessly switch between connected devices at will. The 30 m wireless range provides freedom to roam while staying connected. Transition between phone chats, video conferencing, music, and general noise reduction throughout your day-all with the same headset and happy-making acoustic performance.

TURN YOUR iPad INTO A LAPTOP WITH ONE CLICK
Now you can enjoy laptop-like typing anywhere you take your iPad® (5th, 6th, 7th gen) or iPad Air® (3rd gen). This all-in-one case has a slim and light design that makes it easy to use and carry around, all while keeping your iPad safe from bumps, scratches, and spills. No matter where you need to get your work done - a café table, desk, or even your lap - Slim Folio locks your iPad at an optimal angle for typing, viewing, or sketching and holds firm on any surface.
3 USE MODES
Slim Folio offers three unique modes to help you accomplish any task.
Type Mode: Just dock the keyboard upright and type away.
Sketch Mode: Collapse the iPad screen to take notes or draw with Logitech Crayon.
Read Mode: Fold the keyboard back to read books, articles, and more.
COMFORTABLE LAPTOP-LIKE TYPING
Enjoy hours of comfortable, flexible typing thanks to large, well-spaced keys stretched edge-to-edge so your hands won't feel crowded. Our premium keyboards are designed to deliver the perfect bounce every time you press a key for fast, accurate typing. With a full row of shortcut keys, you can perform your favorite iOS-specific actions and optimize your productivity.
CONVENIENTLY INTEGRATED KEYBOARD
Slim Folio's keyboard is integrated into the case so it won't get lost and is always there when you're ready to type.
2 ANGLES FOR TYPING, VIEWING, AND SKETCHING
In Type Mode, Slim Folio holds your iPad at a 58° angle that's great for getting work done with the keyboard. Collapse the case and Slim Folio will hold your iPad at a comfortable 10° angle that's optimal for viewing your favorite shows, handwriting notes, drawing, and more.
FRONT AND BACK PROTECTION
Slim Folio carefully envelopes your iPad for protection against bumps, scratches, and spills. On the inside, a lightweight frame and keyboard module provide structural integrity without weighing down your iPad.
HOME FOR LOGITECH CRAYON AND OTHER DIGITAL PENCILS
Sketch, write, then store your Logitech Crayon® or Apple Pencil (1st gen) where it won't get lost or in the way. The convenient holder will keep it firmly in place until you're ready to use it next.

The Next Step in Mechanical Keyboards
The Apex Pro is the biggest leap in mechanical keyboards since the invention of the mechanical switch over 35 years ago. Each key can be adjusted to meet your preferred sensitivity level, whether it's for gaming, work, or anything else.
8X FASTER RESPONSE
5X FASTER ACTUATION
2X MORE DURABLE
Adjustable mechanical switches
From the world's fastest featherlight touches, to deep and deliberate keypresses, the Apex Pro doesn't just adapt to every game, it seamlessly adjusts to you.
Record-breakingly fast
Use a sensitive actuation for WASD and in-game ability keys that need the absolute fastest split-second edge on the competition. Or, adjust slightly deeper for speed with added precision.
Deep & deliberate
Use a deeper actuation for typing or gaming with extreme accuracy. Any key set at this level will register when you've confidently pressed it, giving you less typos and more peace of mind.
OLED Smart Display
An integrated command center displays useful information for adjusting settings, changing profiles, and seeing on-the-fly updates. Avoid tabbing out of what you're doing, and instead let your keyboard show you the important details.
SAVE CUSTOM MACROS
ADJUST ACTUATION DISTANCE
CONTROL PRISM EFFECTS
Aircraft Grade Aluminum Alloy
The Series 5000 metal frame is manufactured for a lifetime of unbreakable durability and sturdiness, making it the perfect centerpiece of any high end setup.
Premium Magnetic Wrist Rest
The perfect keyboard accessory, with a simple magnetic solution for easy and secure attachment, full palm support, and durable soft touch finish, so you're comfortable typing and gaming for as long as you want.
Dedicated Multimedia Controls
A clickable metal roller and the media key allows you to adjust volume and settings on the fly: change brightness, rewind, skip, pause and more, all at the touch of a button.
USB Passthrough Port
No more crawling behind your PC to plug in USB devices. Instead, insert a flash drive, wireless mouse/headset transmitter, phone, or any USB device directly into the keyboard.
Three-Way Cable Routing
Prevent your cable from stretching, pulling, and getting in the way. The frame has built-in channels that allow you to choose from one of three possible places for your cable to exit, keeping your desk tidy.
Dynamic Per-Key RGB Illumination
Millions of color options and reactive typing effects make you the designer of your ultimate setup. Sync up with your other SteelSeries gear for the most gorgeous setup ever.

Blue Microphone,,Accessories,988-000088,836213000281.0,98.21,17.0,"Blue Yeti Nano Wired Condenser Microphone - 20 Hz to 20 kHz - Cardioid, Omni-directional - Desktop, Stand Mountable - USB GREY YETI NANO
Small Footprint. Big Sound.
Yeti Nano includes everything you need to stream your message with crystal clarity. We designed two new proprietary mic capsules specifically tuned to give your voice exceptional presence and detail. Plus, Yeti Nano supports high-quality 24-bit/48kHz recording, so you can give your podcast, YouTube video or Twitch stream the production value it deserves. Whether you're gaming, making a business call, or recording, you'll be heard loud and clear every time.
Designed for Easy Streaming and Recording
Every aspect of Yeti Nano is designed to help you record and stream easily. The compact footprint and all-new aesthetic fits perfectly on any desktop and looks great on camera. The built-in metal stand makes it easy to adjust the angle of the mic exactly where you need it.
Capture Your Voice, or Many
Whether you plan to record a single source, or multiple sources at once, Yeti Nano gives you flexibility with two pickup-pattern modes to choose from. Simply tap the pattern-selection button to set the one that's right for your project.
Works Great With Your Favorite Applications
Yeti Nano Polar Patterns
CARDIOID MODE
Perfect for podcasts with a single host, game streaming, Skype calls, vocal performances, voiceovers and instruments. Cardioid mode records sound sources that are directly in front of the microphone, delivering rich, full-bodied sound.
OMNIDIRECTIONAL
Record or stream sound equally from all around the mic. Omnidirectional mode is best used in situations when you want to have a conference call with multiple participants in the same room, or a multi-person interview on a podcast.
Your Message - Loud and Clear
PRO FEATURES
Yeti Nano is a computer microphone designed for desktop use. When you're ready to start streaming or make a Skype call, just plug your headphones into the no-latency headphone port and adjust the volume to hear your voice in real time. And if you need to sneeze mid-stream? Just tap instant mute and make all the noise you want without being heard.
SOFTWARE CONTROL
For quick direct control, the Blue Sherpa companion app helps you get the most out of this powerful computer microphone. Mute and unmute your mic and headphones, fine-tune gain and levels, switch polar patterns, and change sample rates. Sherpa will also download firmware updates directly to your Yeti Nano, seamlessly keeping you up to date.

Get essential laptop protection with the 15.6"" UltraLight Backpack. Its dedicated side-loading laptop compartment is outfitted with plenty of padding to help protect your device. We've incorporated a secondary compartment that's ideal for files, folders, and larger accessories. But that's not where its storage ends. Smaller accessories like ear buds, pens, smartphone chargers, and business cards can be stored in the two front quick-access pockets.
The backpack is made for comfort, too, with an air mesh back panel that promotes airflow, and contoured shoulder straps that make sure the brunt of your pack's weight on your shoulders is manageable. More than that, though, we've designed this backpack to be incredibly lightweight - without skimping on laptop protection.

Blue Microphone,Yeti Professional Multi-Pattern USB Mic for Recording & Streaming,Accessories,988-000100,836213002070.0,126.41,9.0,"Blue Yeti Wired Condenser Microphone - Stereo - 20 Hz to 20 kHz - Cardioid, Bi-directional, Omni-directional - Desktop, Stand Mountable, Side-address - USB
YETI FOR ANY APPLICATION
From professional podcasting to music recording, Twitch Streaming, and even YouTube videos, Yeti carries your projects to studio-quality heights.
Blue Microphones' proprietary tri-capsule technology gives you four distinct pattern modes to choose from:
TOTAL RECORDING CONTROL WITH YETI
Yeti features studio controls for headphone volume, pattern selection, instant mute and microphone gain-putting you in charge of every level of the recording process. If you're experiencing distortion or feedback while recording an especially loud source-like the deafening sound of an avalanche-simply adjust the microphone's sensitivity with the gain control. Or if you want to take a break in the middle of a podcast, use the instant mute button.
Yeti computer microphone comes equipped with a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack that allows you to listen to what you're recording in real-time, without latency delays-that means no more hearing a note 3 seconds after you played it. You can adjust the volume of your headphones using the control on the front of the microphone.
INNOVATIVE DESIGN MAKES RECORDING EASY
Yeti doesn't mind getting pushed around-it lets you adjust and pivot the microphone in relation to the sound source, which optimizes your sound quality. Once you've achieved the desired angle, simply hand-tighten the set knobs to secure it in place. Yeti is a side-address condenser microphone, so you can capture the best sound by going face-to-face with it. The microphone can also be folded down for easy portability, or removed completely from its base for mounting directly on a mic stand or Radius II shockmount.
HASSLE-FREE SETUP
Simply plug Yeti into your computer's USB port with the included USB cable, calibrate it with your operating system, and you're ready to record-rain, shine or snow. Yeti offers driver-free operation, while the Yeti Pro requires easy-to-install drivers, available from Blue.
Yeti is compatible with Windows 10, Windows 8 (including 8.1), Windows 7, Windows Vista, Windows XP (Home and Professional), and Mac OS X (10.4.11 or higher), and requires a minimum of 64 MB of RAM.
The Yeti USB Microphone is backed by a two-year limited warranty.
START RECORDING QUICKLY
Who needs a learning curve? Yeti was designed with a convenient, no-hassle workflow in mind. Set up in seconds with the included desktop microphone stand or connect directly to a mic stand. Adjust microphone gain, pick up pattern, headphone volume, or mute/unmute with easy-to-reach controls. And record in comfort with Yeti's side-address operation-just speak, sing or play into the Yeti on the same side as the Blue logo to capture pro sound.
Accessorize Your Studio
Transform your desktop into a broadcast studio with Compass broadcast boom arm, Radius III shockmount and Yeti, the world's #1 USB microphone. With professional features, studio sound quality and sophisticated on-camera looks, you have everything you need for professional podcasting, game streaming and voice over work.

Stereo headphones deliver exceptional performance during one-on-one instruction. Padded headband is adjustable to provide a comfortable fit for extended wearing periods. Mono/stereo switch allows users to quickly switch between music and computer applications. Permanently attached cord with a reinforced ""strain"" connection prevents it from detaching for lasting use. 10' coiled cord is long enough to reach ports located at the rear of a computer. Dual volume controls on each earcup allow personalized comfort. Noise-reducing earcup lowers ambient noise so the volume does not need to be played at high levels. ABS plastic headstrap and earcups resist breakage for continued usage in demanding environments.

Steelseries,,Accessories,62446,813682023591.0,79.35,14.0,"SteelSeries Rival 600 Mouse - TrueMove3+ - Cable - Black - USB - 12000 dpi - Scroll Wheel - 7 Button(s) - Right-handed Only MOUSE
2 SENSORS FOR NEXT LEVEL PRECISION
Introducing the world's most advanced sensor system, the TrueMove3+. The new dual sensor system combines true 1 to 1 tracking with breakthrough state-of-the art lift off distance detection. For the first time ever, you are in complete control - even on lift off.
Optical Depth Sensor
True depth perception for the world's most precise and lowest lift off detection down to 0.5mm. Elevate your skill ceiling to the next level with increased accuracy, more control, and faster movement.
TrueMove 3 Optical Sensor
TrueMove3 sets the new standard for all gaming sensors in the past and the future. Experience incredibly accurate crosshair placement for all movements. No acceleration, no tracking errors, and no lag.
Depth Perception Increases Accuracy
While most gaming mice process lift off distance from a single primary sensor, the Rival 600 deploys a state-of-the-art dedicated depth sensor to achieve the world's lowest and most accurate lift off distance. Never again have unnecessary movement when you pick up and put down your mouse.
True Precision is Distortion Free
TrueMove3 is a 12,000 CPI, 350 IPS optical sensor built exclusively with industry leader PixArt. Instead of focusing on CPI alone, TrueMove3 was engineered for true 1 to 1 tracking. Moving a specific distance on a mousepad results in the same exact distance on screen, without introducing latency, interpolation, or affecting jitter reduction.
PERFECT WEIGHT AND BALANCE
The all new center of gravity tuning system includes moveable weights and light-to-heavy customization, delivering the widest range of adjustment of any gaming mouse.
96g to 128g Range of Weight
The removable sides allow easy and secure placement of the eight included 4g weights. Lock in the exact weight you want with light-to-heavy customization.
256 Weight and Balance Configurations
Tune your center of gravity with customizable weight combinations for the perfect balance of any grip or game play style.
BUILT FOR ESPORTS
Developed with the three basic principles of revolutionary performance, unreal durability, and powerful flexibility, the Rival 600 delivers when the pros need it the most, in battle.
60-Million Click Mechanical Switches
The left/right click features a revolutionary reinforced split-trigger system that delivers the best clicks in gaming. Our exclusive 60-million click mechanical switches ensure every type of press is executed with precision.
Durable Silicone Side Grips
The Rival 600 side grips feature a unique silicone compound to allow for increased grip and durability. Crafted and designed to meet the stringent demands of professional players.
Powerful 32-bit ARM Processor
The 32-bit ARM processor delivers low-latency performance and allows you to save CPI and lift off sensor settings, custom lighting effects, button key-binds and full macros on-board for software-free use at LAN events and tournaments.
Rev Up the Engine
SteelSeries Engine Software unlocks an impressive arsenal of Engine Apps that make customization of the 8-zone RGB lighting easy and intuitive. The Discord and GameSense Engine Apps allow for chat notifications, in-game events, and more.

RECOMMENDED GRIP STYLES
Every aspect of the Rival 600 design meets players' demands for comfort. Whether you deploy a claw grip or palm grip, the shape provides lasting comfort for long and intense gaming sessions.

Targus,,Accessories,AST325GLZ,92636346553.0,41.93,5.0,"Targus 4Vu Privacy Screen Protector Clear - For 12.3""LCD Notebook - Anti-glare PRO LTE LANDSCAPE CLEAR
Overview
Designed to fit the Microsoft Surface® Pro LTE, the 4Vu™ Privacy Screen protects your information as tiny vertical blinds on the surface of the privacy screen narrow the viewing angle so data is only visible directly in front of the monitor up to 30° away from the center of the screen.
Onlookers will only see a dark unclear screen when attempting to view the information from a side angle when held in landscape orientation. In addition to providing security, the screen also blocks the glare to help reduce eye strain. The 4Vu Privacy Screen can be easily attached by using clear adhesive strips designed for LCD screens.
Easy Installation Options
The 4Vu™ Privacy Screen comes with reusable silicon adhesive and tab guides so you can quickly and easily attach the screen directly to your display.
30° Viewing Angle
Even in public places like hotel lobbies, airplanes, or cafes, the 4Vu Privacy Screen keeps your data safer from prying eyes. Your content is visible only to the person directly in front of the screen and up to 30° on either side. You have full clarity and visibility, while onlookers or passersby see only a black screen.
Reduced Glare, Even in Bright Rooms
Our Low-Reflective Coating reduces glare and improves light transmittance under most viewing conditions.
Blue Light Filtering
Current studies suggest that prolonged exposure to blue light - emitted by virtually every digital device we own - may be linked to eye strain and fatigue, headaches, retina damage, and other health concerns. The 4Vu Privacy Screen filters blue light to reduce eye strain and minimize the potentially harmful effects on your vision.

The Next Step in Mechanical Keyboards
The Apex Pro is the biggest leap in mechanical keyboards since the invention of the mechanical switch over 35 years ago. Each key can be adjusted to meet your preferred sensitivity level, whether it's for gaming, work, or anything else.
8X FASTER RESPONSE
5X FASTER ACTUATION
2X MORE DURABLE
Discover the Difference
Adjustable mechanical switches
From the world's fastest featherlight touches, to deep and deliberate keypresses, the Apex Pro doesn't just adapt to every game, it seamlessly adjusts to you.
Record-breakingly fast
Use a sensitive actuation for WASD and in-game ability keys that need the absolute fastest split-second edge on the competition. Or, adjust slightly deeper for speed with added precision.
Deep & deliberate
Use a deeper actuation for typing or gaming with extreme accuracy. Any key set at this level will register when you've confidently pressed it, giving you less typos and more peace of mind.
OLED Smart Display
An integrated command center displays useful information for adjusting settings, changing profiles, and seeing on-the-fly updates. Avoid tabbing out of what you're doing, and instead let your keyboard show you the important details.
SAVE CUSTOM MACROS
ADJUST ACTUATION DISTANCE
CONTROL PRISM EFFECTS
Aircraft Grade Aluminum Alloy
The Series 5000 metal frame is manufactured for a lifetime of unbreakable durability and sturdiness, making it the perfect centerpiece of any high end setup.
Premium Magnetic Wrist Rest
The perfect keyboard accessory, with a simple magnetic solution for easy and secure attachment, full palm support, and durable soft touch finish, so you're comfortable typing and gaming for as long as you want.
Dedicated Multimedia Controls
A clickable metal roller and the media key allows you to adjust volume and settings on the fly: change brightness, rewind, skip, pause and more, all at the touch of a button.
USB Passthrough Port
No more crawling behind your PC to plug in USB devices. Instead, insert a flash drive, wireless mouse/headset transmitter, phone, or any USB device directly into the keyboard.
Three-Way Cable Routing
Prevent your cable from stretching, pulling, and getting in the way. The frame has built-in channels that allow you to choose from one of three possible places for your cable to exit, keeping your desk tidy.
Dynamic Per-Key RGB Illumination
Millions of color options and reactive typing effects make you the designer of your ultimate setup. Sync up with your other SteelSeries gear for the most gorgeous setup ever.
Customize Everything
SteelSeries Engine unlocks a library of features for all SteelSeries products, so you can customize, sync, and tweak your setup to perfection.

Targus,,Accessories,AST325GLZ,92636346553.0,42.330000000000005,5.0,"Targus 4Vu Privacy Screen Protector Clear - For 12.3""LCD Notebook - Anti-glare PRO LTE LANDSCAPE CLEAR
Overview
Designed to fit the Microsoft Surface® Pro LTE, the 4Vu™ Privacy Screen protects your information as tiny vertical blinds on the surface of the privacy screen narrow the viewing angle so data is only visible directly in front of the monitor up to 30° away from the center of the screen.
Onlookers will only see a dark unclear screen when attempting to view the information from a side angle when held in landscape orientation. In addition to providing security, the screen also blocks the glare to help reduce eye strain. The 4Vu Privacy Screen can be easily attached by using clear adhesive strips designed for LCD screens.
Easy Installation Options
The 4Vu™ Privacy Screen comes with reusable silicon adhesive and tab guides so you can quickly and easily attach the screen directly to your display.
30° Viewing Angle
Even in public places like hotel lobbies, airplanes, or cafes, the 4Vu Privacy Screen keeps your data safer from prying eyes. Your content is visible only to the person directly in front of the screen and up to 30° on either side. You have full clarity and visibility, while onlookers or passersby see only a black screen.
Reduced Glare, Even in Bright Rooms
Our Low-Reflective Coating reduces glare and improves light transmittance under most viewing conditions.
Blue Light Filtering
Current studies suggest that prolonged exposure to blue light - emitted by virtually every digital device we own - may be linked to eye strain and fatigue, headaches, retina damage, and other health concerns. The 4Vu Privacy Screen filters blue light to reduce eye strain and minimize the potentially harmful effects on your vision.

Steelseries,Apex PRO Keyboard,Accessories,64626,813682023645.0,197.73,2.0,"SteelSeries Apex PRO Keyboard - Cable Connectivity - USB Interface Volume Control, Skip, Pause, Rewind, Brightness Hot Key(s) - Mac OS, PC, Windows - Mechanical Keyswitch - Black
The Next Step in Mechanical Keyboards
The Apex Pro is the biggest leap in mechanical keyboards since the invention of the mechanical switch over 35 years ago. Each key can be adjusted to meet your preferred sensitivity level, whether it's for gaming, work, or anything else.
8X FASTER RESPONSE
5X FASTER ACTUATION
2X MORE DURABLE
Discover the Difference
Adjustable mechanical switches
From the world's fastest featherlight touches, to deep and deliberate keypresses, the Apex Pro doesn't just adapt to every game, it seamlessly adjusts to you.
Record-breakingly fast
Use a sensitive actuation for WASD and in-game ability keys that need the absolute fastest split-second edge on the competition. Or, adjust slightly deeper for speed with added precision.
Deep & deliberate
Use a deeper actuation for typing or gaming with extreme accuracy. Any key set at this level will register when you've confidently pressed it, giving you less typos and more peace of mind.
OLED Smart Display
An integrated command center displays useful information for adjusting settings, changing profiles, and seeing on-the-fly updates. Avoid tabbing out of what you're doing, and instead let your keyboard show you the important details.
SAVE CUSTOM MACROS
ADJUST ACTUATION DISTANCE
CONTROL PRISM EFFECTS
Aircraft Grade Aluminum Alloy
The Series 5000 metal frame is manufactured for a lifetime of unbreakable durability and sturdiness, making it the perfect centerpiece of any high end setup.
Premium Magnetic Wrist Rest
The perfect keyboard accessory, with a simple magnetic solution for easy and secure attachment, full palm support, and durable soft touch finish, so you're comfortable typing and gaming for as long as you want.
Dedicated Multimedia Controls
A clickable metal roller and the media key allows you to adjust volume and settings on the fly: change brightness, rewind, skip, pause and more, all at the touch of a button.
USB Passthrough Port
No more crawling behind your PC to plug in USB devices. Instead, insert a flash drive, wireless mouse/headset transmitter, phone, or any USB device directly into the keyboard.
Three-Way Cable Routing
Prevent your cable from stretching, pulling, and getting in the way. The frame has built-in channels that allow you to choose from one of three possible places for your cable to exit, keeping your desk tidy.
Dynamic Per-Key RGB Illumination
Millions of color options and reactive typing effects make you the designer of your ultimate setup. Sync up with your other SteelSeries gear for the most gorgeous setup ever.
Customize Everything
SteelSeries Engine unlocks a library of features for all SteelSeries products, so you can customize, sync, and tweak your setup to perfection.

Ultimate Ears,,Accessories,984-001390,97855141088.0,198.06,10.0,"Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM 3 Portable Bluetooth Speaker System - Night Black - 60 Hz to 20 kHz - 360° Circle Sound - Battery Rechargeable BLK
MEGABOOM 3

Portable wireless Bluetooth®speaker: super-powerful and immersive 360° sound, thundering bass, water, dust & drop proof, and stunning high-performance fabric. It's the ultimate speaker, redefined.
LOUD AND TRUE
MEGABOOM 3 features powerful, immersive sound. But it's also carefully balanced and perfectly clear. Featuring Ultimate Ears unique sound processing, it produces audio faithful to the music you love, and at every volume level.
SPATIAL 360° SOUND
In MEGABOOM 3 we've perfected the iconic cylindrical design we pioneered to deliver immersive, stereophonic audio that radiates evenly in all directions.
THUNDERING BASS
MEGABOOM 3's extra size and larger woofer create intense bass you can both hear and feel - 50% deeper than BOOM. But unlike most other portable speakers, it's true to your music. No exaggeration or distortion.
VIRTUALLY INDESTRUCTIBLE
MEGABOOM 3 is built tough and ready for adventure. We put it through more than 25 rigorous durability tests including 1000s of button pushes, tumbles, drop tests and more. You can drop it, kick it, headbang with it, even spill your drink on it, and your MEGABOOM 3 speaker will take it all like a champ. Rock on.
MEET THE ALL-NEW MAGIC BUTTON
With MEGABOOM 3 you can play, pause and skip tracks directly on the speaker. Just push for convenient control of any streaming music. Or program and navigate custom one-touch playlists for Apple Music® and Deezer® Premium. Match the moment with the vibes without reaching for your phone.
LIGHT-SHIFTING FABRIC
MEGABOOM 3 are covered in a two-tone fabric that's as tough as it is hot-damn beautiful. Engineered for applications like motorcycle jackets and fire equipment, this performance textile is built for extremes. And colored two ways by our custom dying process, it comes to life in a range of drool-worthy iridescent themes.
INDUSTRY LEADING BATTERY LIFE
The kick-ass sound of MEGABOOM 3 is matched by its massive 20-hour battery life. Using the latest battery cell technology powering high performance electric cars, it will last almost a full day on a single charge. Party. Til. You. Drop.
WATERPROOF & FLOATS
Dunk it. Splash it. Drench it. Crank it. MEGABOOM 3 is designed to get seriously wet and keep on booming. Featuring a ridiculous IP67 water and dustproof rating, it can be totally submerged in water for up to 30-minutes. Plus, it floats too. So if you drop it in the pool, it will pop to the surface in seconds-ready to rage.
CHARGE-N-GO WITH POWER UP
Throw Power Up charging dock into your basket (sold separately) so you can grab-and-go with your MEGABOOM 3, fully charged, to your next musical adventure.
BLOCK PARTY
You and up to 2 friends can join Block Party in the BOOM & MEGABOOM App and see who's the better DJ with MEGABOOM 3.
APP
Use your App to download the features like Block Party, PartyUp Remote On/Off, Customizable EQ, Musical Alarm, Tap Controls and more.

Visiontek,,Accessories,900855,784090034274.0,29.03,3.0,"VisionTek 5 Device Charging Station - Docking - iPhone, iPad, Scanner, iPod, Tablet PC, USB Device, e-book Reader, 3D Glasses, Mobile Phone, Gaming Console - Charging Capability - 5 x USB
The VisionTek 5 Device Charging Station fast charges up to five smartphones, tablet computers, eReaders... virtually any USB chargeable mobile device!

The use of multiple mobile devices by families, small businesses, health care facilities, and restaurant operations is a now daily occurrence. Unfortunately, power adapters for devices can get lost and wall outlets can only charge two devices simultaneously. Typical charging hubs don't offer enough ports and/or enough power per port so you spend time waiting for a full charge or worse, only end up with a partial charge.

The VisionTek 5 Device Charging Station is the uncommonly powerful, centralized charging solution for charging up to five devices as fast as the factory adapter.* It features five ports that support up to 3A per port, with a total combined output of 8A. Charge your small mobile devices like Apple® iPods® and iPhones® while you simultaneously charge your iPads®, tablet computers, and smartphones that require higher amperage power charging, without worrying about being plugged into the correct USB outlet.

Intelligent charging of all your devices... legacy to latest!

Featuring a removable power adapter, the VisionTek 5 Port Charging Station eliminates the ""wall wart"" common with electronic devices. Just plug the power cord into a wall outlet to enjoy multi-device charging and storage. The internal 5 Port Charging Hub uses intelligent charging technology to auto detect what current an attached device needs and then provides the proper amount for safe charging. Because the 5 Port Charging Hub uses the common USB connector, all of your new and old USB devices can be charged at their optimum rate.

Neatly store your devices while they charge.
The VisionTek 5 Device Charging Station was designed to help you neatly store your multiple devices while charging them. The five slots on the charging station hold most devices, with three 3/4"" wide slots for devices with thicker cases on the, and two 1/2"" wide slots for slimmer devices. The wide base and sturdy dividers safely support your devices while they charge.

The bottom of the VisionTek 5 Device Charging Station slides out to give you access to both the charging brick and the cable storage area. Notches in the side of the charging station allow you to feed as much cord through as you need, while safely and neatly tucking the rest of your cables away, keeping them untangled and your charging area mess free.

You can take it with you... with or without the 5 Port Charging Station dock.
The removable bottom on the VisionTek 5 Port Charging Station not only gives you access to the cord storage area, but it allows you to lift out the 5 Port Charging Hub. You can take it with you for high speed charging of up to five devices anywhere there is a standard wall socket. Since the 5 Port Charging Hub has a built in power adapter, all you will need to take with you is the included cord... there's no adapter to misplace or take up space in your bag.

Logitech,Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad,Accessories,943-000093,97855120496.0,19.33,11.0,"Logitech Cloth Gaming Mouse Pad - 11.03"" x 13.39"" x 0.04"" Dimension - Cloth MOUSE PAD FOR GAMING MICE
Moderate surface friction
Crafted for control
Gamers using low-DPI settings, benefit from moderate resistance to the mouse feet when starting or stopping a rapid movement. Heat-treated at 200° C, the cloth surface of G240 provides just the right amount of friction for low-DPI maneuvers.

Consistent surface texture
Edge-to-edge performance
Heavy patterns and designs can interfere with sensor performance. G240 features a clean, consistent surface texture. This gives sensors better imagery for translating mouse movement into cursor movement, an improvement over inconsistent or dirty table and desk surfaces.
Matched to Logitech G sensors
Better together
Whether using an optical or laser mouse, G240 can give gamers access to enhanced sensor accuracy and precision. G240 uses a surface texture comparable to the optimal testing environment for Logitech G mice.
Stable rubber base
A winning foundation
The rubber base firmly bonded to the cloth helps keep the flexible surface in place and prevent the cloth from bunching up in front of the mouse, interfering with smooth mouse movement.
Comfortable
cloth construction
At just 1mm thick, G240 maintains a low profile. The soft fabric improves comfort as the wrist moves back and forth across the mouse pad's edge.
Roll for transport
Take it with you
With a flexible cloth construction, G240 rolls up for easy transport and lies flat when you're ready to play. Protect the mouse pad when you take it to LAN events using the hexagonal packaging.
