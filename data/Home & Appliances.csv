The consistent delivery of microwave energy means delicate foods can simmer without the edges and surfaces overcooking. Foods have the look and taste you expect -- without the wait!
Inverter Turbo Defrost
Panasonic has succeeded in evolving the Turbo Defrost, which allows you to defrost foods even faster than previous Panasonic Auto Defrost. Panasonic Inverter Defrost technology is an advanced microwave sequencing system using the inverter continuous-power delivery feature.
Auto Cook and Reheat
The one-touch buttons adjust power levels and calculates cooking and reheating time automatically for various food types.
Keep Warm Feature
A pulsing delivery of very low microwave power keeps food temperatures at a constant level -- without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy, and desserts remain warm in the oven until ready to serve.
Pop-Out Dial
With a spin of the dial, the easy-to-use pop-out dial is a departure from the standard keypad found on most microwave ovens.
Quick Minute Feature
The one-touch button allows you to automatically set the time in increments of 1 minute.

The integrated micro-computer automatically optimises the cooking temperature to match the menu selection. For example, brown rice can be easily cooked and steamed foods, which normally require difficult heat control, can be quickly and easily prepared in the included steam basket.
Easy-to-Use Control Panel
The front control panel is set at an angle that makes it easy to see in the kitchen. Illustrated menu buttons also make operation easy even for first-time users.
Compact and Simple Design
A survey indicated that approximately 70% of all users generally do not carry the rice cooker around, so a simple, compact design with no carrying handle was selected. Naturally to enable the rice cooker to be stable and safely carried on occasion, easy-to-grip indentations are provided at the bottom of the unit.

Durable and long-lasting, each stainless steel cookware item is crafted with a heavy-gauge aluminum core for excellent heat conduction. With even heating across the pot or pan, meals turn out perfectly for family and friends.
Stainless Steel Handle(s)
Pans such as sauce pans and fry pans feature a long, stainless steel handle that remains cool while cooking on the stovetop.
Dishwasher Safe
Spend less time in the kitchen. After all the cooking and prepping is done, place cookware in the dishwasher for fast and easy cleanup.
Tips for Stacking Cookware
Cookware with the same diameters stack and nest in any order. For example, a 2.5 qt. sauce pan has an 8"" diameter. Look for other 8"" diameter products to complete your stack. For the most efficient space saving, starting from the bottom, stack cookware in order from shallowest to deepest with lids on top.

Microwaving Has Evolved
Unlike traditional microwaves that rely on pulse-on, pulse-off cooking at lower temperatures, patented Inverter Technology generates a steady stream of power at all temperature settings. The result? Consistent, evenly prepared food - edges to center - across a wider range of cooking techniques. This delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect, without the wait. Most important, everyone enjoys delicious food that's easier and faster to prepare, and better retains its color, texture and nutrients.
1250 Watt high power enables quicker cooking times in a full-size 1.6 cubic feet interior. The precision touch-button control panel and four-digit green display provide a sleek, high-end look and a practically effortless cooking experience. And nine preset menu options for everyday meals, side dishes, vegetables and more maximize everyday cooking convenience. Choose between stylish white or black door and exterior countertop models. Each is designed to complement any décor and provide a minimal footprint on countertops.
Better Cooking with Inverter Technology
Patented Inverter Technology delivers a seamless stream of cooking power even at low settings. With the continuous, linear output of Inverter, not only will your food be easily and quickly prepared, you can confidently cook, and even poach, braise and steam foods to perfection. Just as important, the essential vitamins and nutrients you expect in all your meals will be retained.
Great Cooking, No Guesswork
With one-touch sensor cook and reheat, Panasonic takes the guesswork out of creating great meals by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking, defrosting and reheating times. The sensor measures the amount of steam naturally produced during cooking and signals the oven's advanced microprocessor to automatically calculate the remaining cooking time at any power level for optimum results.
Sensor Inverter Turbo Defrost
The microwave oven is also designed with Turbo Defrost to help prepare food more efficiently than any Panasonic microwave before it. This advanced feature utilizes a microwave sequencing system based on Inverter's continuous-power delivery method to thaw foods more evenly and quickly.
Sleek Controls
A sleek, touch-button control panel and four-digit display provide a high-end look. And nine preset menu options provide automatic convenience for hot cereals and omelets, frozen after-school snacks, vegetables, frozen entrees, pasta, potatoes and more. Controls and sensors automatically set power levels, monitor and cooking time and when done, keep foods warm until ready to serve.
Keep Warm Feature
Keeps foods like vegetables, soups, hors d'oeuvres, gravies, sauces and desserts warm and delicious in the oven until they're ready to serve. The microwave delivers a pulsing, automatic stream of low microwave power to maintain constant temperature levels in foods without overcooking.
More Conveniences
More everyday advantages include a quick-minute timer that lets you set cooking and reheating times in single-minute intervals, or add another minute when needed. And a handy delay start feature and bright, time-of-day clock and versatile timer provide additional convenience. For safety, a child safety lock is also included to keep young hands from operating the oven.

Tripp Lite,Portable Cooling Unit / Air Conditioner 12K BTU 3.5kW 120V 60Hz,Home & Appliances,SRCOOL12K,37332145765.0,1255.0,8.0,"Tripp Lite Portable Cooling Unit / Air Conditioner 12K BTU 3.5kW 120V 60Hz - Gen 2 Update - 1 Pack - 247 CFM - 21.5 mL/min - Portable - Black - IT, Industrial - 12660.7 kJ - 3500 W - Black - 120 V AC - 1400 W AIR CONDITIONING 12 000 BTU 120V
Tripp Lite's award-winning SRCOOL12K, now in its second generation, is a portable, compact, self-contained air conditioning unit designed for server rooms, small network closets, back offices and other areas with heat-sensitive equipment that facility air conditioning can't reach. Design improvements based on customer feedback include upgraded commercial-grade components designed to last longer, including an upgraded hot air exhaust fan. The SRCOOL12K Gen 2 also boasts robust packaging for better protection from shipping damage and an updated two-year warranty. This SmartRack® server rack cooling unit pumps 12,000 BTU (3.5kW) of cooling into your IT environment to help prevent shutdowns, malfunctions and other failures caused by overheating or fluctuating temperatures. It uses environmentally friendly R410A refrigerant to comply with worldwide standards. An easy-to-read control panel with diagnostic LEDs provides convenient local management. Close-coupled cooling delivers cold air near heat loads to discourage recirculation and increase energy efficiency. An included 71-inch flexible hose lets you aim the cold air to a specific spot, such as an overheated rack enclosure or an equipment hot spot. Hot air exits through a window or drop ceiling via an included exhaust kit. An upgraded hot air exhaust fan maintains effectiveness even under a high heat load. The unit also dehumidifies and filters the air, providing better air quality that can enhance operating conditions and equipment reliability. With a 100-percent duty cycle, the SRCOOL12K can run continuously without costly downtime. It uses copper tubing that is stronger than the aluminum tubing used in most consumer cooling units. The copper allows higher pressures and better weld joints to stand up to the constant vibration of the running compressor. The evaporator expels the condensed water through the directional exhaust duct, eliminating the need for a drain tube, drain pan or water collection tank and saving you time and money. No external condenser, refrigerant piping or professional maintenance is required for simple operation. Upgraded firmware allows the compressor to cycle on and off while the evaporator fan stays on to prevent icing in high-humidity environments. Install the optional SRCOOLNETLX network module (sold separately) to monitor temperatures, receive alerts, review logs and control settings from anywhere, anytime, via SNMP, web browser, SSH, telnet or command line interface. The built-in LX Platform's PowerAlert® Device Manager provides a single interface to cycle the connected air conditioner on and off, adjust its fan speed, change its target set point temperature and switch to dehumidification mode. The self-contained SRCOOL12K requires no disruptive construction projects or costly service calls from plumbers or HVAC specialists.

The compact, portable unit fits into just 4 square feet of floor space. It is designed for primary, supplemental or backup cooling of IT equipment to prevent shutdowns, malfunctions and costly downtime caused by overheating or fluctuating temperatures.
The self-contained SRCOOL18K packs 18,000 BTU/h (5.275 kW) of cooling capacity into a rack-width chassis. A built-in evaporator expels condensation through a directional exhaust duct, eliminating the need for a floor drain or water collection tank. The SRCOOL18K also dehumidifies and filters the air, providing better air quality that can enhance equipment performance. Efficient close-coupled cooling reduces energy use and operating costs.
Installation is quick and easy and does not require disruptive construction or the costly expense of hiring a plumber or HVAC specialist. The SRCOOL18K rolls into place on durable built-in casters. The NEMA L6-20P plug connects to a standard 208/240V 20A outlet. The unit restarts automatically after power failures, and a built-in timer supports unattended shutdown and startup.
By installing the optional SRCOOLNET2LX network management card (sold separately), you can monitor temperatures, receive alerts, review logs, automate operation and control settings from anywhere via SNMP, web browser, SSH or telnet.

The built-in LX Platform's PowerAlert® Device Manager (PADM) provides a single interface to cycle the connected air conditioner on and off, adjust its fan speed, change its target set point temperature, and switch to dehumidification mode, so excessive heat won't compromise the performance and reliability of your network equipment. The SRCOOLNETLX combines with the air conditioner to deliver a reliable cooling solution that does not require on-site management.
Includes the E2MT E2 Environmental Sensor Module
The SRCOOLNETLX comes with an E2MT module, which can be placed directly inside your rack. You don't need to be on the premises to check the temperature near your rack equipment or make any necessary adjustments. The E2MT module allows you to measure and monitor ambient temperature in your data center environment or control the cooling operation by selecting a target temperature value to ensure that specific network equipment remains cool during operation. The E2MT connects to the SRCOOLNETLX using the included 12-foot USB cable.
Easy to Set Up and Manage
The SRCOOLNETLX installs securely to the air conditioner unit's remote monitoring port using the included cable. A user-supplied Ethernet patch cable connects the SRCOOLNETLX's RJ45 port to an Ethernet network. The built-in PowerAlert Device Manager interface provides a single display for managing both the cooling unit and the E2MT module. You can update the firmware straight from the web interface.
TAA-Compliant for GSA Schedule Purchases
The SRCOOLNETLX is compliant with the Federal Trade Agreements Act (TAA), which makes it eligible for GSA (General Services Administration) Schedule and other federal procurement contracts.

The SRXCOOL12K SmartRack 12,000 BTU 230V Portable Server Rack Cooling System pumps 12,000 BTU of cooling power into your IT environment to prevent shutdowns, malfunctions and failures caused by overheating or fluctuating temperatures. Part of the SRCOOL® line, this compact, portable unit is perfect for server rooms and other IT environments with heat-sensitive equipment in areas that facility air conditioning can't reach.
The self-contained SRXCOOL12K is capable of cooling a small room using its louvered vent. A built-in evaporator expels the condensed water through the directional exhaust duct, eliminating the need for a drain tube, drain pan or water collection tank.
You can also use the included flexible tube to aim the cold air precisely where it's needed most, such as an overheated rack enclosure or an equipment hot spot. The SRXCOOL12K Portable Rack Air Conditioner also dehumidifies and filters the air, providing better air quality that can enhance equipment performance with little power consumption.
Designed for quick, simple installation, the SRXCOOL12K rolls on durable built-in casters and plugs into a standard Schuko CEE7 outlet. It's programmed to restart automatically after power failures, and you can set the built-in timer for unattended shutdown and startup.
By installing the optional SRCOOLNETLX remote management accessory (sold separately), you can also monitor temperatures, receive alerts, review logs and control settings from anywhere via SNMP, web browser, SSH or telnet.

Tripp Lite,Portable Cooling Unit Air Conditioner 24K BTU 7.0kw 208/240V,Home & Appliances,SRCOOL24K,37332184856.0,4710.0,7.0,"Tripp Lite Portable Cooling Unit Air Conditioner 24K BTU 7.0kw 208/240V - Cooler - 7033.71 W Cooling Capacity - Dehumidifier - Black AIR CONDITIONING 24K BTU 208/240V
The SRCOOL24K SmartRack 24,000 BTU 208/240V Portable Rack Air Conditioner cools, dehumidifies and filters the air in your server room, data center or other environment with heat-sensitive equipment. The compact, portable unit fits into just 4 square feet of floor space. It is designed for primary, supplemental or backup cooling of IT equipment to prevent shutdowns, malfunctions and costly downtime caused by overheating or fluctuating temperatures.
The self-contained SRCOOL24K packs 24,000 BTU/h (7kW) of cooling capacity into a rack-width chassis. A built-in evaporator expels condensation through a directional exhaust duct, eliminating the need for a floor drain or water collection tank. The SRCOOL24K also dehumidifies and filters the air, providing better air quality that can enhance equipment performance. Efficient close-coupled cooling reduces energy use and operating costs.
Installation is quick and easy and does not require disruptive construction or the costly expense of hiring a plumber or HVAC specialist. The unit rolls into place on durable built-in casters. The NEMA L6-20P plug connects to a standard 208/240V 20A outlet. The SRCOOL24K restarts automatically after power failures, and a built-in timer supports unattended shutdown and startup.
The included SRCOOLNET2LX network management card lets you monitor temperatures, receive alerts, review logs, automate operation and control settings from anywhere via SNMP, web browser, SSH or telnet. The SRCOOLNET2LX includes the ENVIROSENSE remote sensor, which lets you monitor temperature and humidity up to 12 feet away from the SRCOOL24K.

5 Layer IH Stronger Heat5-layer IH surrounds the pot with uniform heat and traps secondary heat for fluffy cooked rice.

1. Lid IH
2. Upper Side IH
3. Center IH
4. Lower Side IH
5. Bottom IH
7 Layer Diamond Copper Inner Pan

The diamond hard-coated inner layer creates tiny water bubbles to enhance heat circulation and provides 2.5 times the bubbles of conventional rice cookers. The copper-plated outer layer's higher heat conductivity ensures delicious evenly cooked rice.
How IH Works
Traditional rice cookers use a heating element at the bottom of the unit.

Induction rice cookers utilize induction heating technology to heat the ENTIRE inner pan.

With induction technology, the inner cooking pan becomes the heat source, which is activated when coils within the bottom of the rice cooker generate a magnetic field that create instant heat within the inner cooking pan.

Induction technology generates a superior high heat and the rice cooker's micro-computer also engages fine heating adjustments to control the entire cooking process for superior results.
Easy to Use
Removable lid-heating element and seamless parts design for easy maintenance.

One-touch Inner Lid
The top panel detaches easily and can be immersed in water.

Clear Frame
The stainless-steel frame is easy to wipe clean.

Diamond Ceramic Coating
The high durability lets you wash rice right inside the cooker. And the light weight makes it easy to hold even when filled with water.

The Genius Countertop Microwave Oven
With its sleek, stainless-steel door and base and stainless silver body, the powerful Panasonic 1200-Watt microwave makes a stylish and convenient addition to any home, apartment or condo kitchen. This compact, 1.2-cubic-foot microwave features patented Panasonic Inverter technology for consistent, even cooking and delicious results.
The NN-SN686S has sleek, embossed-look membrane keypad and touch controls plus a 13.4-inch turntable to evenly heat and cook breakfast foods, after-school snacks, dinners, appetizers and more. Ideal for singles, busy professionals and on-the-go families, the Panasonic NN-SN686S provides both manual and automatic cooking options, plus an interior big enough for a 13-inch casserole dish and a stylish exterior guaranteed to complement any kitchen décor.
Better Cooking with Inverter Technology
Patented Inverter Technology delivers a seamless stream of cooking power even at low settings. With the continuous, linear output of Inverter, not only will your food be easily and quickly prepared, you can confidently cook, and even poach, braise and steam foods to perfection. Just as important, the essential vitamins and nutrients you expect in all your meals will be retained.
Great Cooking, No Guesswork
With one-touch sensor cook and reheat, Panasonic takes the guesswork out of creating great meals by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking, defrosting and reheating times. The sensor measures the amount of steam naturally produced during cooking and signals the oven's advanced microprocessor to automatically calculate the remaining cooking time at any power level for optimum results.
Sensor Inverter Turbo Defrost
The microwave oven is also designed with Turbo Defrost to help prepare food more efficiently than any Panasonic microwave before it. This advanced feature utilizes a microwave sequencing system based on Inverter's continuous-power delivery method to thaw foods more evenly and quickly.
Sleek Controls
This 1200W high-power microwave represents the best in microwave cooking today. Intelligent, embossed-look membrane keypad and controls provide 14 preset menu options for everyday meals and snacks, plus the manual controls you need for more adventurous menus. Controls and sensors automatically set power levels, monitor and adjust cooking time and when done, keep foods warm until ready to serve.
Added Conveniences
More everyday advantages include a large 13.4-inch diameter glass turntable and a Quick :30 touch control to quickly reheat foods and beverages, and add extra prep time when needed in half-minute increments. A handy delay start feature, 3-stage cooking, bright, time-of-day clock and versatile timer provide even more conveniences. An easy to set child safety lock is also provided to keep young hands from operating the oven.
Maximum Interior, Minimal Footprint
The smarter, more compact transformer and capacitor that comprise the Inverter power unit occupy less interior space than other brands to provide a larger space for cooking. These smaller, more efficient units are also up to 8 pounds lighter than conventional microwave components. All of which adds up to less weight overall and a minimal exterior footprint when placed on a counter.
Keep Warm Feature
A handy keep warm touch control keeps foods warm up to 30 minutes after food is prepared. A steady delivery of low microwave power maintains food temperatures at a constant level without overcooking. So, foods like stew, gravy and desserts remain warm in the oven for up to half an hour after cooking.

Microwaving Has Evolved
Unlike traditional microwaves that rely on pulse-on, pulse-off cooking at lower temperatures, patented Inverter Technology generates a steady stream of power at all temperature settings. The result? Consistent, evenly prepared food - edges to center - across a wider range of cooking techniques. This delivery of microwave energy allows delicate foods to simmer without overcooking, so foods have the look and taste you expect, without the wait. Most important, everyone enjoys delicious food that's easier and faster to prepare, and better retains its color, texture and nutrients.
1250 Watt high power enables quicker cooking times in a full-size 1.6 cubic feet interior. The precision touch-button control panel and four-digit green display provide a sleek, high-end look and a practically effortless cooking experience. And nine preset menu options for everyday meals, side dishes, vegetables and more maximize everyday cooking convenience. Choose between stylish white or black door and exterior countertop models. Each is designed to complement any décor and provide a minimal footprint on countertops.
Better Cooking with Inverter Technology
Patented Inverter Technology delivers a seamless stream of cooking power even at low settings. With the continuous, linear output of Inverter, not only will your food be easily and quickly prepared, you can confidently cook, and even poach, braise and steam foods to perfection. Just as important, the essential vitamins and nutrients you expect in all your meals will be retained.
Great Cooking, No Guesswork
With one-touch sensor cook and reheat, Panasonic takes the guesswork out of creating great meals by automatically setting power levels and adjusting cooking, defrosting and reheating times. The sensor measures the amount of steam naturally produced during cooking and signals the oven's advanced microprocessor to automatically calculate the remaining cooking time at any power level for optimum results.
Sensor Inverter Turbo Defrost
The microwave oven is also designed with Turbo Defrost to help prepare food more efficiently than any Panasonic microwave before it. This advanced feature utilizes a microwave sequencing system based on Inverter's continuous-power delivery method to thaw foods more evenly and quickly.
Sleek Controls
A sleek, touch-button control panel and four-digit display provide a high-end look. And nine preset menu options provide automatic convenience for hot cereals and omelets, frozen after-school snacks, vegetables, frozen entrees, pasta, potatoes and more. Controls and sensors automatically set power levels, monitor and cooking time and when done, keep foods warm until ready to serve.
Keep Warm Feature
Keeps foods like vegetables, soups, hors d'oeuvres, gravies, sauces and desserts warm and delicious in the oven until they're ready to serve. The microwave delivers a pulsing, automatic stream of low microwave power to maintain constant temperature levels in foods without overcooking.
More Conveniences
More everyday advantages include a quick-minute timer that lets you set cooking and reheating times in single-minute intervals, or add another minute when needed. And a handy delay start feature and bright, time-of-day clock and versatile timer provide additional convenience. For safety, a child safety lock is also included to keep young hands from operating the oven.

Panasonic,360° Quick NI-W950A Clothes Iron,Home & Appliances,NI-W950A,885170100985.0,126.0,13.0,"Panasonic 360° Quick NI-W950A Clothes Iron - Automatic Shut Off - Anodized Aluminum Sole Plate - 10 fl oz Reservoir Capacity - Anti-Calcium System - 1700 W - Silver, Violet W/CURVED ALUMITE SOLEPLATE
NI-W950A 360° Quick™ Steam/Dry Iron
This sleek, multi-directional iron delivers 1700-Watts of power and 360° steam to glide through everyday ironing with a sleek, ergonomic design and non-stick, double-tipped soleplate. A five-setting heat control dial provides the ideal temperatures for different fabrics, and four adjustable steam settings make short work of wrinkles and creases.
Smooth, Alumite Soleplate
The large, ultra-smooth anodized aluminum soleplate is an excellent heat conductor for faster heating, and highly scratch resistant for years of easier ironing. Plus, its unique elliptical surface slides effortlessly in any direction on any fabric to help reduce ironing time.
All the Right Temperatures
Iron quickly and evenly with a five-setting temperature control dial designed to monitor and maintain the precise temperature you choose for different fabrics. A bright indicator light illuminates when the proper temperature is reached.
Adjustable 360° Steam and Dry Settings
With a smart arrangement of steam vents around the soleplate's edges, the iron applies more steam over a wider ironing area for more efficiency in less time. Set to HIGH for heavier and everyday fabrics, LOW for more delicate fabrics and quick, easy touch-ups or choose DRY for ironing when no steam is needed.
Clog-Free Steam Vents
Automatically keep your iron's steam vents clean, clear and steaming like new with a built-in anti-calcium cleaning system to reduce natural sediment build-up in the iron's vaporizing chamber.
Jet-of-Steam Power
With the one-touch Jet-of-Steam feature, a powerful burst of steam through the soleplate quickly penetrates clothing, sheets and more to help you tackle tough wrinkles and creases. And when ironing is done, another burst through the soleplate also helps clear the iron's steam vents.
Smooth Curtains and Drapes
With the push of a button, the iron's vertical steam feature directs a full burst of steam to relax and remove winkles in hanging garments, curtains, drapes and more.
Anti-Drip System
An anti-drip system provides a long-life water seal inside the iron to protect fabrics from water spotting.
Intelligent 3-Way Shut-Off
For safety, a smart sensor automatically deactivates the iron when it's left standing in the upright position for 10 minutes, after 60 seconds if the iron is left unattended on its soleplate or if tipped over on its side.
A Perfect Shot of Mist
As you iron, a one-touch spray mist button instantly puts an extra shot of moisture exactly when and where you need it. Ideal for stubborn wrinkles and creases.
Extra-Long Power Cord
Iron more conveniently with the freedom of an extra-long 10-foot power cord.
