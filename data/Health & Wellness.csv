Cta Digital Inc.,Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser,Health & Wellness,ADD-AUTOSP,656777018160.0,81.0,15.0,"CTA Digital Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser - Automatic - Spill-free SANITIZER DISPENSER
Our Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser provides a hands-free sanitizing station wherever you need one - on a wall, on a kiosk, or on-the-go. This versatile unit clamps easily to CTA's mobile floor stands and mounts directly into CTA's Paragon floor stands. It can also be mounted onto walls or other flat, hard surfaces with screws (included), silicone, or double-sided foam adhesive pads (adhesives not included).
This hand sanitizer can be powered in two ways. For permanent installations, use the side port DC plug. To go cordless, simply use four 5V batteries (not included).
Once in place, the sensor automatically detects a hand, then delivers a supply of sanitizer - all without buttons, levers, or the need to touch the dispenser. Refills are a snap. Use the included key to open the front shell.
Use either the included refillable bottle or replace with a new disposable bag. To prevent messy spills, add one of CTA's compatible soap catching drip trays to create a complete hand sanitizing solution.

Airpop produces the most advanced consumer masks available today, providing wearers with professional-grade filtration combined with the highest levels of comfort for easy breathing. All Airpop masks act as a two-way barrier for both the wearer and those near the wearer, unlike regular disposable or fashion masks. The bi-directional 4-layer filter barrier blocks air-based droplets, bacteria, pollen and dust particles >0.3 micron. Independently tested by the Swiss lab SGS, the masks have the following proven filtration efficiency: 99.9% of bacteria (BFE test) and >99% of airborne droplets and particles down to 0.3 microns (PFE test). The filter is electrostatically charged to block ultrafine particles. Thanks to their superior qualities, the masks conform to or exceed EU CWA 17553:2020 and French AFNOR SPEC S76-001 barrier-mask guidelines.
The Airpop Kids Mask was created based on global insights and the most up-to-date material science. It combines a fitted face covering and a lightweight barrier against fluids, to create a totally new filtration and breathing experience that is effective for up to one week. Made for children aged 4-12 as well as for adults with smaller faces, the Airpop Kids Mask is compatible with the Airpop Storage Case (sold separately). The mask is held away from the wearer's face by its 3D shape which, combined with a cushioned nose seal, creates an ""air dome"". This allows for superior airflow and gives a cool, light experience. In addition, the nose seal provides for easy positioning and an anti-fogging effect when wearing glasses. All dyes and prints used for these masks are 100% skin friendly and hypoallergenic.

Thanks to their superior qualities, the masks conform to or exceed EU CWA 17553:2020 and French AFNOR SPEC S76-001 barrier-mask guidelines.
The Airpop Kids Mask was created based on global insights and the most up-to-date material science. It combines a fitted face covering and a lightweight barrier against fluids, to create a totally new filtration and breathing experience that is effective for up to one week. Made for children aged 4-12 as well as for adults with smaller faces, the Airpop Kids Mask is compatible with the Airpop Storage Case (sold separately). The mask is held away from the wearer's face by its 3D shape which, combined with a cushioned nose seal, creates an ""air dome"". This allows for superior airflow and gives a cool, light experience. In addition, the nose seal provides for easy positioning and an anti-fogging effect when wearing glasses. All dyes and prints used for these masks are 100% skin friendly and hypoallergenic.

Strax Americas,AirPop Original Mask (Black),Health & Wellness,43305,850020741755.0,48.0,10.0,"AirPop Original Mask (Black) - Comfortable, Breathable, Filter, Durable, Reusable, Washable, 4-layered Filter, Adjustable Ear Strap - Bacteria, Airborne Particle Protection - MicroFiber Shell - Black BLACK
Airpop produces the most advanced consumer masks available today, providing wearers with professional-grade filtration combined with the highest levels of comfort for easy breathing. All Airpop masks act as a two-way barrier for both the wearer and those near the wearer, unlike regular disposable or fashion masks. The bi-directional 4-layer filter barrier blocks air-based droplets, bacteria, pollen and dust particles >0.3 micron. Independently tested by the Swiss lab SGS, the masks have the following proven filtration efficiency: 99.9% of bacteria (BFE test) and >99% of airborne droplets and particles down to 0.3 microns (PFE test). The filter is electrostatically charged to block ultrafine particles. Thanks to their superior qualities, the masks conform to or exceed EU CWA 17553:2020 and French AFNOR SPEC S76-001 barrier-mask guidelines.
The award-winning Airpop Original Mask was created based on global insights and the most up-to-date material science to deliver a totally new filtration and breathing experience. It combines a reusable and washable microfiber shell with a replaceable filter. The outer shell made from engineered soft-touch microfiber is designed to perfectly fit your face. 300+ micro-apertures evenly channel air to nose and mouth ensuring optimal heat and moisture exchange to deliver market-leading comfort. The mask is held away from the wearer's face by its flex-frame design that creates an ""air dome"". This allows for superior airflow and keeps the face cool, while a 360° soft-touch adaptive seal minimizes ingress.
Airpop is the world's first Air-Wearables company. They deliver superior performance by combining cutting-edge materials and innovative design to solve three critical issues: fit, filtration, and breathability.

Black Box Corporatio,BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk with Face Mask Detection,Health & Wellness,BDS-8W,,2214.0,18.0,"Black Box BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk with Face Mask Detection - 5.2"" Width x 1"" Depth x 11.7"" Height - 1 - Silver RECOGNITION HDMI OUT AUDIO WALMOUNT
With COVID-19 restrictions slowly being lifted, many businesses are looking to adopt strategies and technologies that allow a safe return to operations. The BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk uses advanced infrared thermal imaging and fast temperature detection, to help identify the presence of elevated temperatures. As part of a safety program, it provides peace of mind to concerned employees, customers, visitors, and the general public.
Contactless Temperature Reading in less than a Second
Get temperature information quickly, accurately, and safely. The BDS-8 kiosk reads a visitor's temperature in less than one second with an accuracy of ±0.9° F (±0.5° C), without any direct contact. Once a visitor's temperature is read, a message pops up on the kiosk's screen with temperature data. If the kiosk detects an elevated temperature, on-screen and optional audio alerts go off. The BDS-8 kiosk can detect temperatures up to 3.2 feet (1 meter) away and has a temperature range of 50° F to 107.6° F (10 to 42° C).
Detect and Track Multiple People
The BDS-8 kiosk can read multiple visitors' temperatures at the same time, making it ideal for applications that see a lot of foot traffic, like schools, hospitals, malls, and more.
Accurate Facial Recognition and Mask Detection
With facial recognition technology and a storage capacity of up to 30,000 faces, the BDS-8 kiosk can also function as a check-in and check-out system for registered users. Facial scanning can even deny access to strangers and detect if people are wearing masks.
Integrate with Any Security or Door System
Worried that you won't be able to add this kiosk to your pre-existing security or door system? Don't be. The BDS-8 kiosk works with any security system you may have in place. It can be used with access gates and attendance systems in office buildings, schools, hotels, sporting events, transportation hubs, and countless other private and public spaces.
BDS Remote Management Software
Cloud-hosted, PC-based software enables an administrator to remotely deploy and manage kiosks, define entrance conditions, monitor users and their activities, receive email alerts, manage blacklists and visitor lists, and much more - all from a single dashboard. The software is included at no extra cost.
Integrate with Your Digital Signage System
The BDS-8 kiosk does much more than keep people safe from sickness. This versatile solution can display digital signage content that advertises your products and services when no temperature scanning is being performed.
Plug-and-Play Installation
Any user can set up the BDS-8 kiosk. Just plug it in, and you're ready to start using it.
Mount the Kiosk However You Want
We offer three different BDS-8 models: floorstand, wallmount, or tabletop. Choose whichever works best for your application.

Our Automatic Hand Sanitizer Dispenser provides a hands-free sanitizing station wherever you need one - on a wall, on a kiosk, or on-the-go. This versatile unit clamps easily to CTA's mobile floor stands and mounts directly into CTA's Paragon floor stands. It can also be mounted onto walls or other flat, hard surfaces with screws (included), silicone, or double-sided foam adhesive pads (adhesives not included).
This hand sanitizer can be powered in two ways. For permanent installations, use the side port DC plug. To go cordless, simply use four 5V batteries (not included).
Once in place, the sensor automatically detects a hand, then delivers a supply of sanitizer - all without buttons, levers, or the need to touch the dispenser. Refills are a snap. Use the included key to open the front shell.
Use either the included refillable bottle or replace with a new disposable bag. To prevent messy spills, add one of CTA's compatible soap catching drip trays to create a complete hand sanitizing solution.

Black Box Corporatio,BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk with Face Mask Detection,Health & Wellness,BDS-8W,,2247.0,3.0,"Black Box BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk with Face Mask Detection - 5.2"" Width x 1"" Depth x 11.7"" Height - 1 - Silver RECOGNITION HDMI OUT AUDIO WALMOUNT
With COVID-19 restrictions slowly being lifted, many businesses are looking to adopt strategies and technologies that allow a safe return to operations. The BDS-8 Temperature Screening Kiosk uses advanced infrared thermal imaging and fast temperature detection, to help identify the presence of elevated temperatures. As part of a safety program, it provides peace of mind to concerned employees, customers, visitors, and the general public.
Contactless Temperature Reading in less than a Second
Get temperature information quickly, accurately, and safely. The BDS-8 kiosk reads a visitor's temperature in less than one second with an accuracy of ±0.9° F (±0.5° C), without any direct contact. Once a visitor's temperature is read, a message pops up on the kiosk's screen with temperature data. If the kiosk detects an elevated temperature, on-screen and optional audio alerts go off. The BDS-8 kiosk can detect temperatures up to 3.2 feet (1 meter) away and has a temperature range of 50° F to 107.6° F (10 to 42° C).
Detect and Track Multiple People
The BDS-8 kiosk can read multiple visitors' temperatures at the same time, making it ideal for applications that see a lot of foot traffic, like schools, hospitals, malls, and more.
Accurate Facial Recognition and Mask Detection
With facial recognition technology and a storage capacity of up to 30,000 faces, the BDS-8 kiosk can also function as a check-in and check-out system for registered users. Facial scanning can even deny access to strangers and detect if people are wearing masks.
Integrate with Any Security or Door System
Worried that you won't be able to add this kiosk to your pre-existing security or door system? Don't be. The BDS-8 kiosk works with any security system you may have in place. It can be used with access gates and attendance systems in office buildings, schools, hotels, sporting events, transportation hubs, and countless other private and public spaces.
BDS Remote Management Software
Cloud-hosted, PC-based software enables an administrator to remotely deploy and manage kiosks, define entrance conditions, monitor users and their activities, receive email alerts, manage blacklists and visitor lists, and much more - all from a single dashboard. The software is included at no extra cost.
Integrate with Your Digital Signage System
The BDS-8 kiosk does much more than keep people safe from sickness. This versatile solution can display digital signage content that advertises your products and services when no temperature scanning is being performed.
Plug-and-Play Installation
Any user can set up the BDS-8 kiosk. Just plug it in, and you're ready to start using it.
Mount the Kiosk However You Want
We offer three different BDS-8 models: floorstand, wallmount, or tabletop. Choose whichever works best for your application.

Catalyst,3 Ply Face Mask,Health & Wellness,9001,840625106448.0,69.0,16.0,"Catalyst 3 Ply Face Mask - Recommended for: Face - 3-ply, Earloop Style Mask, Adjustable Nose Clip - Respiratory Droplet Protection - Spandex Ear Loop, Nylon Ear Loop, Non-woven Fabric, Iron Nose Clip, Polypropylene Nose Clip - 100 / Box
PROTECT YOUR STAFF. MAKE CUSTOMERS FEEL SAFE
The CDC recommends wearing a face mask as a simple barrier covering the mouth and nose. This can help prevent infected individuals from scattering respiratory droplets into the air and onto other people via coughing, coughs, sneezing, or talking.
Aside from statutory requirements or unintended workforce interruptions, customers need to know that your business operates safely. Preventative mitigation reduces the risk of business interruption and related financial losses.
This face mask is to be used for source control only, and is not personal protective equipment. This is not a substitute for filtering facepiece respirators or surgical face masks. Businesses should consider also adding another barrier of protection with a face shield to complement the use of this face mask, when sustained close contact with customers or other employees is unavoidable and necessary.
3-PLY DESIGN WITH EAR LOOPS AND ADJUSTABLE NOSE CLIP
The face mask is constructed using a 3-ply design, providing greater breathability and comfort for the wearer. The Spandex and Nylon ear loops are comfortable and resist up to 10N force. The built-in nose clip adjusts fit to the shape of the nose and avoids gaps in protection and fogging for eyeglass wearers.
EXTRA PROTECTION FOR STAFF AGAINST DROPLETS & RESPIRATORY EMISSIONS
The CDC recommends wearing a face mask for source control, which means that the face masks act as a simple barrier covering the mouth and nose to prevent infected individuals, who may or may not have symptoms of COVID-19, from scattering respiratory droplets into the air and onto other people when the person wearing the face mask coughs, sneezes, talks, or raises their voice. This face mask is to be used for source control only, and is not personal protective equipment, meaning this is not a substitute for filtering facepiece respirators or for surgical face masks. Businesses should consider also adding another barrier of protection by using a face shield to complement the use of this face mask, when sustained close contact with customers or other employees is unavoidable and necessary.
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS & STRINGENT QUALITY CONTROL
The CATALYST® Face Mask has been tested against US, EU, and Chinese standards and is manufactured in a facility that is ISO 13485 certified. Our on-the-ground team conducts engineering, evaluation, development, production, quality control and quality assurance. We have also validated this product through testing at accredited independent third-party test labs and reviewed this product for regulatory compliance, working with a team of regulatory consultants and lawyers with decades of experience conducting medical device reviews with the FDA.
FDA EMERGENCY USE AUTHORIZATION ONLY
The CATALYST® Face Mask is authorized in the US by the FDA for use by the general public and health care personnel for source control. The FDA has not reviewed, cleared or approved this product for any other purpose. The authorization is in effect for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of the emergency use of medical devices during the COVID-19 outbreak, under section 564(b)(1) of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act, 21 U.S.C. § 360bbb-3(b)(1), unless the authorization is terminated or revoked sooner.

Strax Americas,AirPop Original Mask (Brown),Health & Wellness,43345,850020741809.0,48.0,14.0,"AirPop Original Mask (Brown) - Recommended for: Face - Comfortable, Breathable, Filter, Durable, Reusable, Washable, 4-layered Filter, Adjustable Ear Strap - Bacteria, Airborne Particle, Pollen, Dust Protection - MicroFiber Shell - Brown BEIGE
Airpop produces the most advanced consumer masks available today, providing wearers with professional-grade filtration combined with the highest levels of comfort for easy breathing. All Airpop masks act as a two-way barrier for both the wearer and those near the wearer, unlike regular disposable or fashion masks. The bi-directional 4-layer filter barrier blocks air-based droplets, bacteria, pollen and dust particles >0.3 micron. Independently tested by the Swiss lab SGS, the masks have the following proven filtration efficiency: 99.9% of bacteria (BFE test) and >99% of airborne droplets and particles down to 0.3 microns (PFE test). The filter is electrostatically charged to block ultrafine particles. Thanks to their superior qualities, the masks conform to or exceed EU CWA 17553:2020 and French AFNOR SPEC S76-001 barrier-mask guidelines.
The award-winning Airpop Original Mask was created based on global insights and the most up-to-date material science to deliver a totally new filtration and breathing experience. It combines a reusable and washable microfiber shell with a replaceable filter. The outer shell made from engineered soft-touch microfiber is designed to perfectly fit your face. 300+ micro-apertures evenly channel air to nose and mouth ensuring optimal heat and moisture exchange to deliver market-leading comfort. The mask is held away from the wearer's face by its flex-frame design that creates an ""air dome"". This allows for superior airflow and keeps the face cool, while a 360° soft-touch adaptive seal minimizes ingress.
Airpop is the world's first Air-Wearables company. They deliver superior performance by combining cutting-edge materials and innovative design to solve three critical issues: fit, filtration, and breathability.

Strax Americas,AirPop Active Mask (grey),Health & Wellness,43315,850020741694.0,58.0,14.0,"AirPop Active Mask (grey) - Recommended for: Face, Indoor, Outdoor - Comfortable, Breathable, Filter, Durable, Reusable, Washable, 4-layered Filter, Adjustable Ear Strap, Light Duty - Bacteria, Airborne Particle, Dust, Pollen Protection - MicroFiber Shell - Black WHITE/GREY
Airpop produces the most advanced consumer masks available today, providing wearers with professional-grade filtration combined with the highest levels of comfort for easy breathing. All Airpop masks act as a two-way barrier for both the wearer and those near the wearer, unlike regular disposable or fashion masks. The bi-directional 4-layer filter barrier blocks air-based droplets, bacteria, pollen and dust particles >0.3 micron. Independently tested by the Swiss lab SGS, the masks have the following proven filtration efficiency: 99.9% of bacteria (BFE test) and >99% of airborne droplets and particles down to 0.3 microns (PFE test). The filter is electrostatically charged to block ultrafine particles. Thanks to their superior qualities, the masks conform to or exceed EU CWA 17553:2020 and French AFNOR SPEC S76-001 barrier-mask guidelines.
The award-winning Airpop Active Mask is designed for anyone on the move, but is especially suited for sports and other activities involving intensive breathing. Based on global insights and the most up-to-date material science, it combines a reusable and washable Airknit shell with a replaceable filter to create a totally new filtration and breathing experience. Airpop Active contains specific zones of high air flow through a combination of engineered knitting and compression forming. The mask is held away from the wearer's face by its flex-frame design that creates an ""air dome"". This allows for superior airflow and keeps the face cool, while a 360° soft-touch adaptive seal minimizes ingress. The result is Airpop's is most breathable mask.
Airpop is the world's first Air-Wearables company. They deliver superior performance by combining cutting-edge materials and innovative design to solve three critical issues: fit, filtration, and breathability.
