All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

ASUS VG278QR Gaming Monitor - 27inch, Full HD, 0.5ms, 165Hz, FreeSync/Adaptive Sync
Designed for intense, fast-paced games, ASUS VG278QR is a 27"" Full HD gaming display with an ultra-fast 0.5ms response time and blazing 165hz refresh rate to give you super-smooth gameplay. VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology to eliminate screen tearing and choppy frame rate.

Gamer-centric features like ASUS GamePlus enhances your
in-game experience, while GameVisual provides various pre-set display modes to optimise visuals for different types of games.
Speed, speed, and more speed
Lightning-fast 0.5ms response time with ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur
ASUS VG278QR is the fastest in its class, boasting a 0.5ms response time to eliminate smearing and motion blur. This lets you react instantly to what you see onscreen, especially in fast paced games - allowing you to take corners like a pro race car driver, or get that headshot like a seasoned pro.
There's also the ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) Technology to make objects in motion look even sharper, so gameplay is more fluid and responsive.
Incredible 165hz refresh rate
With an astonishing 165hz refresh rate, fast-moving visuals pose no problem for VG278QR. There's no frustrating lag, so you get the upper hand in first person shooters, racers, real-time strategy and sports titles.
Adaptive-Sync technology for smooth gameplay
VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology - it eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates to give you seamless visuals and smooth gameplay.
GameFast Input Technology - because milliseconds count
Input lag on an LCD monitor is typically much lower than a TV, and ASUS VG278QR features GameFast Input Technology to further minimise input lag. This technology provides much faster motion delivery so you'll always be up to speed with in-game action at the precise timing you need to respond as quickly as is needed.
Gamer-centric features
ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology
ASUS VG278QR features the ASUS-exclusive GamePlus hotkey to give you in-game enhancements that help you get more out of your game.
This function is co-developed with pro-gamer input, allowing them to practice and improve their gaming skills.
A crosshair overlay provides four different crosshair options, so you can select the one that best suits the shooter you're currently playing.

TUF Gaming VG32VQ has a super-fast 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that even fast-paced games played at the highest visual settings look buttery smooth and completely lag-free. Get the upper hand in first-person-shooters, racing, real-time strategy and sports titles.
EXTREME LOW MOTION BLUR SYNC
With ELMB SYNC, you can enable ELMB (low-motion-blur technology) and FreeSync at the same time, eliminating ghosting and tearing for sharp visuals and high frame rates while gaming.
Multi HDR Mode
Now you can choose from multiple HDR modes to adjust monitor HDR performance based on the current viewing scenario
Shadow Boost
ASUS Shadow Boost technology clarifies dark areas of the game without overexposing brighter areas, improving overall viewing while also making it easier to spot enemies hidden in dark areas of the map.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Mimo Monitors,,Displays,UM-760CH-OF,6.06346E+11,223.62,4,"Mimo Monitors UM-760CH-OF 7"" Open-frame LCD Touchscreen Monitor - 16:9 - 15 ms - 7"" Class - CapacitiveMulti-touch Screen - 1024 x 600 - WSVGA - 262,144 Colors - 700:1 - 250 Nit - LED Backlight - Speakers - HDMI - USB - RoHS - 1 Year PCAP TOUCH
Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Eizo,"FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" (80 cm) LCD Monitor",Displays,EV3285FX-BK,6.90592E+11,1825.74,3,"EIZO FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" 4K UHD LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - Black, White - 3840 x 2160 - 16.7 Million Colors - 350 Nit Typical - 5 ms GTG - HDMI - DisplayPort - Speaker EV3285FX-BK
Quadruple the Size of Your Work Space
Because various applications are used at work, a high resolution monitor with a large amount of work space is ideal for improving productivity. The EV3285 supports 4K resolution, displaying four times the amount of standard full HD monitors. With 4K you can display all applications on the one screen, without needing to switch windows or scroll through screens, allowing work to progress faster.
Fit 4K Resolution on Any Desk with this Fully Flat and Frameless Design
Conventional 4K monitors are large and bulky, making them difficult to install on small desks. The EV3285 solves this by adopting a fully flat and frameless design which keeps the monitor slim and lightweight. Compared to the previous model, the EV3285 has been reduced in volume by 17%, and the stand base has decreased by 12%. With these reductions, the EV3285 can comfortably fit on any desk.
Beautiful from Front to Back
One Cable ConnectionSingle Cable Connection with USB Type-C
When working on the go, a notebook PC is essential. But when work needs to be done in the office, connecting a notebook PC to an external monitor is beneficial. With USB Type-C, the EV3285 makes this new work style a breeze.
With a single USB Type-C cable you can transmit both video and audio signals, transfer data, and supply up to 60W of power to attached devices such as smartphones and notebooks. What's more, it has an internal power unit so no external AC adapter is required.
Without worrying about your notebook's battery level, you can simple plug it in and begin working immediately on a large external screen. Furthermore, a keyboard and mouse can be connected to the monitor and used instantly once the notebook is plugged in with USB Type-C.
60 W Power Supply for Use with High-End Notebooks
The USB Type-C terminal supplies up to 60 watts of power making it ideal for use with XPS, MacBook Pro, and other high-end notebooks.
Auto Brightness Control
To prevent eye fatigue, a brightness sensor called Auto EcoView detects the changes in the ambient brightness that occurs throughout the day and automatically adjusts the screen to the ideal brightness level.
Reduce Blue Light by 80%
In the visible light spectrum, blue light has wavelengths adjacent to ultraviolet light. Compared to the factory preset setting of 6500 K of typical LCD monitors, Paper Mode is closer to the spectral distribution with long reddish wavelengths so it reduces the amount of blue light, a cause of eye fatigue, and helps prevent eyestrain when reading documents. When used in conjunction with Auto EcoView dimming function, blue light can be reduced by as much as 80%.
Minimum Brightness of Approximately 1 cd/m2
In a dimly-lit work environment, a monitor with low brightness settings is more comfortable to use. With its LED backlight, the monitor is adjustable to approximately 1 cd/m² which is less than 1% of the maximum.
Versatile Stand
The stand features height adjustment, tilt, and swivel, while saving space and remaining stylish. Quickly and smoothly adjust your monitor to the perfect position.
Intelligent Software to Work Better
Auto Color Mode
Use the Auto Color Mode to assign a color mode to turn on when using specific applications such as those for writing documents, photo viewing, creating illustrations or watching movies. When an application is opened the screen will automatically switch to the assigned color mode, making manual switching unnecessary.

CURVED FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE
Optix monitors use a curved display panel that has a curvature rate of R1500, which is the most comfortable and suitable for a wide range of applications from general computing to gaming. Curved panels also help with gameplay immersion, making you feel more connected to the entire experience.
144HZ REFRESH RATE + 1MS RESPONSE TIME
Optix monitors are equipped with a 144hz refresh rate + 1ms response time VA LED panel which has the most benefit in fast moving game genres such as first person shooters, fighters, racing sims, real-time strategy, and sports. These type of games require very fast and precise movements, which an ultra-high refresh rate and fast response time monitor will put you ahead of your competition.
TEAR FREE, STUTTER FREE, FLUID GAMING
Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. With MSI Optix series gaming monitors, it doesn't have to be. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate with AMD FreeSync™ technology.
ANTI-FLICKER TECHNOLOGY
Generic monitor displays normally have a flicker-rate of about 200-times per second, which is unnoticeable to the naked eye, but can cause fatigue over time. MSI Anti-Flicker technology provides a very comfortable viewing experience by reducing the amount of flicker.
BLUE LIGHT REDUCTION
Optix monitors are optimized to produce less amount of blue light displayed by the monitor, so that you can game for longer periods of time without eye-fatigue.
178 DEGREES OF WIDE VIEWING ANGLE
By having a large viewing angle, Optix monitors has more leeway for placing your monitor in your setup without giving up the optimal viewing experience. Colors and details will stay sharp at more angles compared to other monitors with less viewing angles.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

C32G2E 31.5 inch VA, Curved, FreeSync, 1ms, Low Blue Mode, Flicker Free, 165Hz Monitor
C32G2E is the gaming monitor of your choice. At 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, the curved gaming display eliminates screen blur and transmits ultra-smooth imagery. AMD's FreeSync Technology ensures that the refresh rate is constantly synced with your processor which offers intense stutter-free on-screen action. The curved 1500R, VA Panel is equipped with HDR mode and delivers superior consistency with wide viewing angles, giving you everything you need to be on top of the game.
A cutting-edge anti-tearing solution
Screen tearing doesn't only harm gaming performance, it also destroys immersion. AMD FreeSync technology eradicates this disastrous problem by ensuring your monitor's refresh rate is always synced with your processor's.
The e-sports professional standard for gaming
With a 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, your display will be equipped to perform at the pro gaming standard. Enjoy an ultra-smooth experience with no visible screen blur to ensure you're always prepped to win.
HDR mode visual enhancement
Through a combination of advanced algorithmic functions, the HDR Mode essentially transforms non-HDR content into HDR-like visuals via 3 different modes. By enhancing RGBCMY color for more vivid images (via improved saturation and range), increasing dynamic contrast for clarity and image sharpness, the HDR mode ensures you can experience HDR visuals when viewing standard quality content.
CURVED MONITOR
Delivering immersion and eye comfort
Curved screens offer a more immersive user experience that puts you at the center of the action. By mimicking the curvature of the eye, it is also less straining to track movement around the screen. The screen's deeper-than-average curvature provides a more engaging experience and allow you to enjoy beautiful visuals from almost any angle.
ULTRA NARROW BORDER
Slim, sleek, simple
Slim bezel and border monitors offer a comforting viewing experience without distraction. They also save space and can boost productivity via multi-monitor setups. This monitor comes with a 1.5mm ultra-narrow bezel and 5.8mm black screen border.
VA PANEL
Engineered for better visual experiences
The screen's VA panel delivers superior consistency in color temperature, wide viewing angles, and crisp contrast to ensure excellent image reproduction. Enjoy lifelike picture quality from every perspective.
LOW INPUT LAG
Connecting your eyes with your hands
Low input lag streamlines the user-to-monitor input process. This technology provides much faster motion delivery, so you'll always be up-to-speed with in-game action at just the right time.
FLICKER FREE
Protect your eyes from screen flicker
Flicker Free technology uses a smooth backlight system to prevent monitor flickering. This reduces eye strain and other damaging effects to your eyes - an especially valuable feature when working overtime, gaming for long hours or watching movies.
LOW BLUE MODE
Reducing shortwave blue light output for healthier eyes
Long exposure to short wavelength blue light may cause eye strain, sleep disorders, or headaches. AOC Low Blue Mode puts the user first by reducing the screen's short wavelength blue light emission without sacrificing color accuracy. Also provides four different filtering modes - reading, web browsing, multimedia, and office.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Leading in innovation
When you're at the forefront of ingenuity, you get noticed. It's no surprise the Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor - UP3218K has received high praise and awards, including ""Best Monitor"" and ""Best Pixels"".
An unparalleled visual experience
Unprecedented realism: The world's first 31.5"" 8K monitor with Dell PremierColor is designed to impress with accurate colors and smooth gradation to create images so realistic, you don't see pixels.

Details shine: See the most detailed visuals ever on a 31.5"" monitor. With an outstanding 33.2 million pixel resolution and a high pixel density of 280ppi, you'll not miss a single detail.
See what you've been missing
When you compare this 8K monitor to other resolutions, there is no comparison. Four times more content than Ultra HD 4K. Sixteen times more content than Full HD.
Dell PremierColor: Exceptional for Color Professionals
A broad, brilliant spectrum: Dell PremierColor offers wide color coverage that meets major industry standards - 100% AdobeRGB, 100% sRGB, 100% Rec. 709, 98% DCI-P3 - for immaculate, unwavering colors.

Extraordinary color depth: Enjoy a tremendous level of detail that only the depth of 1.07 billion colors (that's 64 times more color depth than standard monitors) could provide. Even in dark areas, you'll see better color gradation and precision in more shades.

Fine-tune with precision: Customize color parameters to your preference using the Custom Color mode, the SDKi or the optional X-rite iDisplay Pro colorimeter.

Accurate color, out of the box: Your monitor is calibrated on AdobeRGB and sRGB to an accuracy of Delta-E less than 2. An included factory calibration report gives you the confidence that colors will be impressively accurate right from the start.
Beautiful and functional
Crafted to perfection: Modern aluminum and refined finishing create a modern and elegant design.

Virtually borderless: With Dell's InfinityEdge, you'll enjoy every detail of on-screen beauty without boundaries. An expansive, edge-to-edge viewing experience on one of the first virtually borderless 31.5"" monitors ensures that you'll be absorbed in the visuals, not distracted by the frame.

Easy on the eyes: This TUV Certified monitor has a flicker-free screen with ComfortView, a feature that filters out harmful blue light emissions to optimize eye comfort.
Superb usability
Customize for your needs: The height-adjustable stand lets you tilt, swivel and pivot to just the right viewing position for a comfortable setup and convenience while collaborating.

Multitasking made easy: Stay organized as you work on multiple applications, thanks to the Easy Arrange feature. Neatly tile the applications on one screen to view them all at once and quickly find exactly what you are looking for.

Made for the way you work: Compatible with multiple stands and mounts (including VESA), this monitor has flexible options to fit perfectly in your workspace.

Eizo,"FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" (80 cm) LCD Monitor",Displays,EV3285FX-BK,6.90592E+11,1806.83,18,"EIZO FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" 4K UHD LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - Black, White - 3840 x 2160 - 16.7 Million Colors - 350 Nit Typical - 5 ms GTG - HDMI - DisplayPort - Speaker EV3285FX-BK
Quadruple the Size of Your Work Space
Because various applications are used at work, a high resolution monitor with a large amount of work space is ideal for improving productivity. The EV3285 supports 4K resolution, displaying four times the amount of standard full HD monitors. With 4K you can display all applications on the one screen, without needing to switch windows or scroll through screens, allowing work to progress faster.
Fit 4K Resolution on Any Desk with this Fully Flat and Frameless Design
Conventional 4K monitors are large and bulky, making them difficult to install on small desks. The EV3285 solves this by adopting a fully flat and frameless design which keeps the monitor slim and lightweight. Compared to the previous model, the EV3285 has been reduced in volume by 17%, and the stand base has decreased by 12%. With these reductions, the EV3285 can comfortably fit on any desk.
Beautiful from Front to Back
One Cable ConnectionSingle Cable Connection with USB Type-C
When working on the go, a notebook PC is essential. But when work needs to be done in the office, connecting a notebook PC to an external monitor is beneficial. With USB Type-C, the EV3285 makes this new work style a breeze.
With a single USB Type-C cable you can transmit both video and audio signals, transfer data, and supply up to 60W of power to attached devices such as smartphones and notebooks. What's more, it has an internal power unit so no external AC adapter is required.
Without worrying about your notebook's battery level, you can simple plug it in and begin working immediately on a large external screen. Furthermore, a keyboard and mouse can be connected to the monitor and used instantly once the notebook is plugged in with USB Type-C.
60 W Power Supply for Use with High-End Notebooks
The USB Type-C terminal supplies up to 60 watts of power making it ideal for use with XPS, MacBook Pro, and other high-end notebooks.
Auto Brightness Control
To prevent eye fatigue, a brightness sensor called Auto EcoView detects the changes in the ambient brightness that occurs throughout the day and automatically adjusts the screen to the ideal brightness level.
Reduce Blue Light by 80%
In the visible light spectrum, blue light has wavelengths adjacent to ultraviolet light. Compared to the factory preset setting of 6500 K of typical LCD monitors, Paper Mode is closer to the spectral distribution with long reddish wavelengths so it reduces the amount of blue light, a cause of eye fatigue, and helps prevent eyestrain when reading documents. When used in conjunction with Auto EcoView dimming function, blue light can be reduced by as much as 80%.
Minimum Brightness of Approximately 1 cd/m2
In a dimly-lit work environment, a monitor with low brightness settings is more comfortable to use. With its LED backlight, the monitor is adjustable to approximately 1 cd/m² which is less than 1% of the maximum.
Versatile Stand
The stand features height adjustment, tilt, and swivel, while saving space and remaining stylish. Quickly and smoothly adjust your monitor to the perfect position.
Intelligent Software to Work Better
Auto Color Mode
Use the Auto Color Mode to assign a color mode to turn on when using specific applications such as those for writing documents, photo viewing, creating illustrations or watching movies. When an application is opened the screen will automatically switch to the assigned color mode, making manual switching unnecessary.

Precise Details to Create Perfection
Design professionals never compromise on details. BenQ Designer Monitors deliver absolute color precision and ultra detailed high resolution to craft every step leading to brilliant work, turning design dreams into reality.
Stunning Color and Resolution for Breathtaking Designs

2K QHD High Resolution
2K QHD (2560x1440) resolution offers extraordinary clarity of fine details and depth of subtle textures optimized for visually intensive work in animation, visual effects, graphics, and photos.
Reference-Grade Color Performance with 100% sRGB and Rec. 709
Covering 100% of sRGB and Rec. 709 color spaces, PD2500Q's advanced IPS wide viewing angle technology minimizes color shift to inspire absolute design confidence. 100% sRGB color gamut accuracy adheres to industry standards in digital production, and Rec. 709 reproduces accurate resolution, frame rate, color gamut, gamma, and white point performance in high-definition video work.
Professionally Factory-Calibrated for Exacting Color Accuracy
Each PD2500Q display is individually factory-calibrated upon production to assure precise Delta-E and Gamma performance. Calibration results are validated against industry color standards to deliver the truest and most representative view of original content. Calibration eliminates slight color performance variations between individual panels of the same model. Therefore, the calibration data of each report will vary slightly from reports from other displays of the same model.
Technicolor Color Certified
Technicolor Color Certification meets strict color standards widely used in Hollywood and entertainment industries. All BenQ PD Series Designer Monitors are Technicolor Color Certified, ensuring consistent and accurate colors for impressive performance in broadcast, film, animation, and entertainment applications.
Smart Efficiency and Productivity Enhancers

Edge-to-Edge Design and Universal Connectivity
Eliminating bulky obstructions with a 25"" edge-to-edge panel and ultra slim bezels, PD2500Q maximizes your workspace for seamless dual-monitor usage via DisplayPort daisy chaining with multi-stream transport (MST) support to extend your notebook screen across several displays. Multiple HDMI, DisplayPort, mini DisplayPort, USB 3.1 Gen1, headphone, and audio ports make PD2500Q ideal for any Windows, Mac, or mobile source devices.
Specialized Designer Modes
Offering superior contrast for lines and shapes in technical illustrations, CAD/CAM mode accentuates the finest details to produce incredible display performance in Pro/E, SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, CATIA, or other design software.
Adjusting image brightness and contrast for superb clarity and detail sharpness, Darkroom mode creates the optimal setting for work in darkened post-processing environments.
Often problematic for designers working with intricate details in dark images, Animation mode enhances the brightness of dark areas without overexposing bright regions. Animation mode provides 10 levels of display brightness to bring out every subtlety clearly in any ambient lighting.
Simply Intuitive Design for Comfortable Creative Process

Anti-Glare Display to Minimize Distracting Reflections
PD2500Q's anti-glare matte finish keeps distracting reflections to a minimum for improved efficiency in squint-free comfort.

TUF gaming VG32VQ

NEXT-GEN ADAPTIVE-SYNC
TUF Gaming VG32V is a 32-inch, WQHD (2560x1440), curved HDR display with an ultrafast 144Hz refresh rate designed for professional gamers and those seeking immersive gameplay. Those are some serious specs, but not even the most exciting thing the VG32V has in store.
For the first time in any gaming monitor, Motion Blur Reduction and Adaptive-sync can be enabled at the same time. This new technology is called ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur Sync (ELMB SYNC). ELMB SYNC works with FreeSync and other types of Adaptive-sync, allowing gamers to enjoy sharp, high speed frames.
31.5"" WQHD curve
The 31.5-inch WQHD (2560 X 1440) panel of TUF Gaming VG32VQ delivers stunning visuals from all angles with an 1800R curvature that ensures every point is equidistant to your eyes. This contributes to greater viewing comfort - even during extended use -and lets you enjoy a wide viewing angle with less distortion and color shift when gaming and watching movies.
144Hz Refresh Rate
TUF Gaming VG32VQ has a super-fast 144Hz refresh rate, ensuring that even fast-paced games played at the highest visual settings look buttery smooth and completely lag-free. Get the upper hand in first-person-shooters, racing, real-time strategy and sports titles.
EXTREME LOW MOTION BLUR SYNC
With ELMB SYNC, you can enable ELMB (low-motion-blur technology) and FreeSync at the same time, eliminating ghosting and tearing for sharp visuals and high frame rates while gaming.
Multi HDR Mode
Now you can choose from multiple HDR modes to adjust monitor HDR performance based on the current viewing scenario
Shadow Boost
ASUS Shadow Boost technology clarifies dark areas of the game without overexposing brighter areas, improving overall viewing while also making it easier to spot enemies hidden in dark areas of the map.
Rich connectivity
Extensive connectivity options, including, DisplayPort 1.2, and HDMI (v2.0) port support a wide array of multimedia devices.

All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

All the essentials, and then some
Maximize your workspace: A thin profilei and improved cable management create a smaller footprint, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Enhanced views: The Full HD resolution is ideal for everyday tasks, while ComfortView is ready for extended viewing periods. It reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Adapts to your needs: Make your workspace your own with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

With its 28-inch 4K UHD display, ASUS VP28UQG gives you stunning 3840 x 2160 resolution visuals with a pixel density of 157PPI for incredible photo-realistic visuals and sharp, crisp text. The VP28UQG gives you four times the pixels of similar-sized Full HD 1080p displays so you get more detailed images when playing games or watching movies, as well as more onscreen desktop space for your various work windows. VP28UQG draws you into immersive virtual worlds, with greatly-textured elements and terrain maps that boast impressive levels of detail.
Conventional 28-inch 1920 x 1080 monitor
Shows less detail and spacing with less room for work bars on the side.
Images are relatively blurrier.
VP28UQG 28-inch 3840 x 2160 monitor
See more details and 3 times more onscreen space for working bar on the side. Images are much more crisp and detailed.
Lightning-fast 1ms rapid response time
Even with today's fastest games, ASUS VP28UQG eliminates smearing and motion blur thanks to a 1ms response time - the fastest in its class. This astonishing visual performance lets you react instinctively to what you see onscreen, so you can take corners like a pro race car driver, or take an enemy out with a headshot as he peeks around cover. In addition, Adaptive-Sync/FreeSync™ eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates for even more seamlessly smooth gameplay.
Robust connectivity
Whether you're playing games or streaming videos, ASUS VP28UQG gives you smooth 4K UHD content playback, thanks to a 60Hz refresh rate and native 4K UHD support via DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI(v 2.0).
Gamer-centric features
ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology
ASUS VP28UQG features the ASUS-exclusive GamePlus to give you in-game enhancements that help you get more out of your game. These tools allow gamers to practice and improve on their gaming skills.
Crosshair
You can choose between four persistent crosshairs and fine tune their position, ensuring pinpoint accuracy in first-person shooters. Enjoy perfect aim even when the game doesn't provide its own crosshair or sights.
Get ready for marathon gaming sessions
Ultra-Low Blue Light technology
ASUS Ultra-Low Blue Light technology reduces the amount of harmful blue light emitted by ASUS VP28UQG. You can access and select four different filter settings onscreen easily through the OSD menu to find the best one that suits the task at hand.

ASUS VG278QR Gaming Monitor - 27inch, Full HD, 0.5ms, 165Hz, FreeSync/Adaptive Sync
Designed for intense, fast-paced games, ASUS VG278QR is a 27"" Full HD gaming display with an ultra-fast 0.5ms response time and blazing 165hz refresh rate to give you super-smooth gameplay. VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology to eliminate screen tearing and choppy frame rate.

Gamer-centric features like ASUS GamePlus enhances your
in-game experience, while GameVisual provides various pre-set display modes to optimise visuals for different types of games.
Speed, speed, and more speed
Lightning-fast 0.5ms response time with ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur
ASUS VG278QR is the fastest in its class, boasting a 0.5ms response time to eliminate smearing and motion blur. This lets you react instantly to what you see onscreen, especially in fast paced games - allowing you to take corners like a pro race car driver, or get that headshot like a seasoned pro.
There's also the ASUS Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB) Technology to make objects in motion look even sharper, so gameplay is more fluid and responsive.
Incredible 165hz refresh rate
With an astonishing 165hz refresh rate, fast-moving visuals pose no problem for VG278QR. There's no frustrating lag, so you get the upper hand in first person shooters, racers, real-time strategy and sports titles.
Adaptive-Sync technology for smooth gameplay
VG278QR features Adaptive-Sync (FreeSync™) technology - it eliminates screen tearing and choppy frame rates to give you seamless visuals and smooth gameplay.
GameFast Input Technology - because milliseconds count
Input lag on an LCD monitor is typically much lower than a TV, and ASUS VG278QR features GameFast Input Technology to further minimise input lag. This technology provides much faster motion delivery so you'll always be up to speed with in-game action at the precise timing you need to respond as quickly as is needed.
Gamer-centric features
ASUS-exclusive GamePlus technology

More productive by design
Adapts to any routine: Make your monitor your own with the height adjustable stand. Raise the stand or tilt the display for improved comfort and ergonomics.

Amplify your work: Lose the sounds of your surroundings and focus on incoming notifications with the new integrated speakers.

A flexible setup: Customize your workspace with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Necessities that go beyond basic
Work with a view: Your work will shine from any angle on this 27-inch display. Full HD resolution with In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology delivers consistent colors across the screen.

Maximize your space: A thin profile, narrow bezel and improved cable management create a small footprint in a wide view, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Ready for long days: ComfortView reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions for extended viewing periods.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

Msi,,Displays,OPTIXG24C4,8.24142E+11,178.66,1,"MSI Optix G24C4 23.6"" Full HD Curved Screen LED Gaming LCD Monitor - 16:9 - 24"" Class - Vertical Alignment (VA) - 1920 x 1080 - 16.7 Million Colors - FreeSync - 250 Nit - 1 ms MPRT - 120 Hz Refresh Rate - HDMI - DisplayPort 1XDISPLAYPORT 1XHDMI 100X100 VESA
CURVED FOR YOUR VIEWING PLEASURE
Optix monitors use a curved display panel that has a curvature rate of R1500, which is the most comfortable and suitable for a wide range of applications from general computing to gaming. Curved panels also help with gameplay immersion, making you feel more connected to the entire experience.
144HZ REFRESH RATE + 1MS RESPONSE TIME
Optix monitors are equipped with a 144hz refresh rate + 1ms response time VA LED panel which has the most benefit in fast moving game genres such as first person shooters, fighters, racing sims, real-time strategy, and sports. These type of games require very fast and precise movements, which an ultra-high refresh rate and fast response time monitor will put you ahead of your competition.
TEAR FREE, STUTTER FREE, FLUID GAMING
Gaming shouldn't be a choice between choppy gameplay or broken frames. With MSI Optix series gaming monitors, it doesn't have to be. Get fluid, artifact-free performance at virtually any framerate with AMD FreeSync™ technology.
ANTI-FLICKER TECHNOLOGY
Generic monitor displays normally have a flicker-rate of about 200-times per second, which is unnoticeable to the naked eye, but can cause fatigue over time. MSI Anti-Flicker technology provides a very comfortable viewing experience by reducing the amount of flicker.
BLUE LIGHT REDUCTION
Optix monitors are optimized to produce less amount of blue light displayed by the monitor, so that you can game for longer periods of time without eye-fatigue.
178 DEGREES OF WIDE VIEWING ANGLE
By having a large viewing angle, Optix monitors has more leeway for placing your monitor in your setup without giving up the optimal viewing experience. Colors and details will stay sharp at more angles compared to other monitors with less viewing angles.

C32G2E 31.5 inch VA, Curved, FreeSync, 1ms, Low Blue Mode, Flicker Free, 165Hz Monitor
C32G2E is the gaming monitor of your choice. At 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, the curved gaming display eliminates screen blur and transmits ultra-smooth imagery. AMD's FreeSync Technology ensures that the refresh rate is constantly synced with your processor which offers intense stutter-free on-screen action. The curved 1500R, VA Panel is equipped with HDR mode and delivers superior consistency with wide viewing angles, giving you everything you need to be on top of the game.
A cutting-edge anti-tearing solution
Screen tearing doesn't only harm gaming performance, it also destroys immersion. AMD FreeSync technology eradicates this disastrous problem by ensuring your monitor's refresh rate is always synced with your processor's.
The e-sports professional standard for gaming
With a 165Hz refresh rate and 1ms response time, your display will be equipped to perform at the pro gaming standard. Enjoy an ultra-smooth experience with no visible screen blur to ensure you're always prepped to win.
HDR mode visual enhancement
Through a combination of advanced algorithmic functions, the HDR Mode essentially transforms non-HDR content into HDR-like visuals via 3 different modes. By enhancing RGBCMY color for more vivid images (via improved saturation and range), increasing dynamic contrast for clarity and image sharpness, the HDR mode ensures you can experience HDR visuals when viewing standard quality content.
CURVED MONITOR
Delivering immersion and eye comfort
Curved screens offer a more immersive user experience that puts you at the center of the action. By mimicking the curvature of the eye, it is also less straining to track movement around the screen. The screen's deeper-than-average curvature provides a more engaging experience and allow you to enjoy beautiful visuals from almost any angle.
ULTRA NARROW BORDER
Slim, sleek, simple
Slim bezel and border monitors offer a comforting viewing experience without distraction. They also save space and can boost productivity via multi-monitor setups. This monitor comes with a 1.5mm ultra-narrow bezel and 5.8mm black screen border.
VA PANEL
Engineered for better visual experiences
The screen's VA panel delivers superior consistency in color temperature, wide viewing angles, and crisp contrast to ensure excellent image reproduction. Enjoy lifelike picture quality from every perspective.
LOW INPUT LAG
Connecting your eyes with your hands
Low input lag streamlines the user-to-monitor input process. This technology provides much faster motion delivery, so you'll always be up-to-speed with in-game action at just the right time.
FLICKER FREE
Protect your eyes from screen flicker
Flicker Free technology uses a smooth backlight system to prevent monitor flickering. This reduces eye strain and other damaging effects to your eyes - an especially valuable feature when working overtime, gaming for long hours or watching movies.
LOW BLUE MODE
Reducing shortwave blue light output for healthier eyes
Long exposure to short wavelength blue light may cause eye strain, sleep disorders, or headaches. AOC Low Blue Mode puts the user first by reducing the screen's short wavelength blue light emission without sacrificing color accuracy. Also provides four different filtering modes - reading, web browsing, multimedia, and office.

OVERVIEW

With 144Hz refresh rate and SuperClear® IPS panel, the ViewSonic XG2705-2K provides a stunning viewing experience. A high 144Hz refresh rate delivers clarity in motion while AMD FreeSync™ Premium, virtually eliminates screen tearing and stuttering for a fluid gaming experience. With 1ms MPRT response time, the monitor delivers smooth images without ghosting. Flexible connectivity via DisplayPort and two HDMI ports make connection to other peripherals or high-end graphics cards for gaming a breeze. The XG2705-2K is also equipped with ViewSonic's exclusive ViewMode™ presets, which offer user-customized game modes, including FPS, RTS and MOBA game settings.
THE PERFECT BLEND FOR ALL GAMERS
The XG2705-2K is designed for hardcore and casual gamers alike, providing the perfect blend of hyper-responsive control and vivid IPS colour. A sleek 3-side borderless, esports-inspired design and 1ms MPRT response time with AMD FreeSync offer seamless visuals for every gaming scenario.
PEAK SPEED AND STUNNING COLOUR
IPS technology, when paired with 144Hz and a 1ms MPRT response time, gives gamers the responsiveness they expect and the rich colour they deserve. With wide-angle viewing as an added benefit, it's perfect for couch co-op, streamer setups and multi-purpose desktop stations.
IMPROVED DETAIL WITH 2K RESOLUTION
Achieve greater levels of detail with 2560x1440 resolution - providing more working space and a greater pixel density. QHD results in a much sharper image, with no distortion or stretching, all while maintaining the same 16:9 aspect ratio.
CLARITY IN MOTION
A 1ms MPRT response time helps to dramatically decrease motion blur - drastically improving left to right moving image clarity, reducing blur, ghosting, and smearing from fast moving objects.
BUILT ON IPS TECHNOLOGY
The best games are a feast for the senses. IPS Technology ensures colours are reproduced with rich authenticity and vibrancy, while maintaining a balanced contrast ratio to preserve an immersive gaming experience.
KEEPING IT TOGETHER
AMD FreeSync technology synchronises your monitor's refresh rate to your graphics card - eliminating screen tearing for a seamless gaming experience.
FULLY LOADED WITH ERGONOMIC FEATURES
The XG2705-2K is designed to give you hours of comfort for your hours of gaming.
HEIGHT ADJUST
Set a higher or lower position to suit your ergonomic or play preferences.
TILT
Alleviate glare or find the perfect position for your eye level.
PIVOT
A 90° rotation to change your monitor from landscape to portrait if the need arises.
SWIVEL
Turn your screen in either direction, without moving the whole monitor stand.
FLEXIBLE CONNECTIVITY
Two HDMI and one DisplayPort inputs offer a wide range of compatibility, giving you ultimate flexibility when connecting all modern devices.
GAME WITHOUT BORDERS
With a sleek, 3-side borderless design, maximise your viewing size while minimising frame distractions. Perfect for multi-display gaming setups, content creation or online streaming.
FLICKER FREE
Traditional LED screens flicker over 250 times per second, at a frequency that is not perceivable to the naked eye. This can cause dryness, headaches and eye sensitivity over long usage periods. ViewSonic has integrated a Flicker Free backlight circuit to alleviate this, resulting in more comfortable display usage.

Open Frame 7"" USB Capacitive Touch Screen Monitor
The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF adds Capacitive touch to the 7"" line of open frame displays. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF is a 7"" small capacitive open frame touchscreen monitor for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but now with the responsiveness of a 5 point multi-touch capacitive touchscreen all in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations. The UM-760C-OF/UM-760CH-OF open frame touchscreen monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.
Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-760C-OF sends video, touch, and power over a single USB connection.
And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-760CH-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. With the HID compliant touch screen plus HDMI video, the new UM-760CH-OF can be installed to almost any platform without drivers.
Uniquely, this new monitor line still reduces number of cables. While a typical HDMI touch display will require 3 separate cables, the new HDMI touch displays from Mimo Monitors only require 2 cables. This simplifies connection, and makes for a more attractive installation.

Leading in innovation
When you're at the forefront of ingenuity, you get noticed. It's no surprise the Dell UltraSharp 32 8K Monitor - UP3218K has received high praise and awards, including ""Best Monitor"" and ""Best Pixels"".
An unparalleled visual experience
Unprecedented realism: The world's first 31.5"" 8K monitor with Dell PremierColor is designed to impress with accurate colors and smooth gradation to create images so realistic, you don't see pixels.

Details shine: See the most detailed visuals ever on a 31.5"" monitor. With an outstanding 33.2 million pixel resolution and a high pixel density of 280ppi, you'll not miss a single detail.

Dell PremierColor: Exceptional for Color Professionals

Eizo,"FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" (80 cm) LCD Monitor",Displays,EV3285FX-BK,6.90592E+11,1763.77,12,"EIZO FlexScan EV3285 31.5"" 4K UHD LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - Black, White - 3840 x 2160 - 16.7 Million Colors - 350 Nit Typical - 5 ms GTG - HDMI - DisplayPort - Speaker EV3285FX-BK
Quadruple the Size of Your Work Space
Because various applications are used at work, a high resolution monitor with a large amount of work space is ideal for improving productivity. The EV3285 supports 4K resolution, displaying four times the amount of standard full HD monitors. With 4K you can display all applications on the one screen, without needing to switch windows or scroll through screens, allowing work to progress faster.
Fit 4K Resolution on Any Desk with this Fully Flat and Frameless Design
Conventional 4K monitors are large and bulky, making them difficult to install on small desks. The EV3285 solves this by adopting a fully flat and frameless design which keeps the monitor slim and lightweight. Compared to the previous model, the EV3285 has been reduced in volume by 17%, and the stand base has decreased by 12%. With these reductions, the EV3285 can comfortably fit on any desk.
Beautiful from Front to Back
One Cable ConnectionSingle Cable Connection with USB Type-C
When working on the go, a notebook PC is essential. But when work needs to be done in the office, connecting a notebook PC to an external monitor is beneficial. With USB Type-C, the EV3285 makes this new work style a breeze.
With a single USB Type-C cable you can transmit both video and audio signals, transfer data, and supply up to 60W of power to attached devices such as smartphones and notebooks. What's more, it has an internal power unit so no external AC adapter is required.
Without worrying about your notebook's battery level, you can simple plug it in and begin working immediately on a large external screen. Furthermore, a keyboard and mouse can be connected to the monitor and used instantly once the notebook is plugged in with USB Type-C.
60 W Power Supply for Use with High-End Notebooks
The USB Type-C terminal supplies up to 60 watts of power making it ideal for use with XPS, MacBook Pro, and other high-end notebooks.
Auto Brightness Control
To prevent eye fatigue, a brightness sensor called Auto EcoView detects the changes in the ambient brightness that occurs throughout the day and automatically adjusts the screen to the ideal brightness level.
Reduce Blue Light by 80%
In the visible light spectrum, blue light has wavelengths adjacent to ultraviolet light. Compared to the factory preset setting of 6500 K of typical LCD monitors, Paper Mode is closer to the spectral distribution with long reddish wavelengths so it reduces the amount of blue light, a cause of eye fatigue, and helps prevent eyestrain when reading documents. When used in conjunction with Auto EcoView dimming function, blue light can be reduced by as much as 80%.
Minimum Brightness of Approximately 1 cd/m2
In a dimly-lit work environment, a monitor with low brightness settings is more comfortable to use. With its LED backlight, the monitor is adjustable to approximately 1 cd/m² which is less than 1% of the maximum.
Versatile Stand
The stand features height adjustment, tilt, and swivel, while saving space and remaining stylish. Quickly and smoothly adjust your monitor to the perfect position.
Intelligent Software to Work Better
Auto Color Mode
Use the Auto Color Mode to assign a color mode to turn on when using specific applications such as those for writing documents, photo viewing, creating illustrations or watching movies. When an application is opened the screen will automatically switch to the assigned color mode, making manual switching unnecessary.

Open Frame 10.1"" IPS USB Monitor
Formerly known as (M101IPS-OF)
The UM-1080-OF/UM-1080H-OF is our widest viewing angle open frame 10.1"" monitor. The UM-1080-OF/UM-1080H-OF is a 10.1"" open frame monitor (display-only) for applications that will be integrated into other equipment or enclosures. Same slick design features but in a long-lasting molded metal product cycle-enclosure. Future generation panels can be phased-in without external changes. The UM-1080-OF/UM-1080H-OF open frame monitor is designed to provide the most cost effective solutions for consumer, retail POS, and hospitality markets.

Available in Single Cable USB Video
Utilizing the same single cable USB display technology as our line of displays, the UM-1080-OF family is our widest viewing angle 10.1"" monitor. The screen can display in either landscape or portrait orientations and has nearly 180 degree viewing angles, all while sending video and power over a single USB cable.

And now available with HDMI
Now optionally available with the ubiquitous HDMI input for video. Previously only available with the convenience of single cable USB video, the UM-1080H-OF from Mimo Monitors now offers HDMI to supplement where USB video is not supported or inconvenient. The new UM-1080H-OF can be installed on almost any platform without drivers.

Precise Details to Create Perfection
Design professionals never compromise on details. BenQ Designer Monitors deliver absolute color precision and ultra detailed high resolution to craft every step leading to brilliant work, turning design dreams into reality.
Stunning Color and Resolution for Breathtaking Designs

2K QHD High Resolution
2K QHD (2560x1440) resolution offers extraordinary clarity of fine details and depth of subtle textures optimized for visually intensive work in animation, visual effects, graphics, and photos.
Reference-Grade Color Performance with 100% sRGB and Rec. 709
Covering 100% of sRGB and Rec. 709 color spaces, PD2500Q's advanced IPS wide viewing angle technology minimizes color shift to inspire absolute design confidence. 100% sRGB color gamut accuracy adheres to industry standards in digital production, and Rec. 709 reproduces accurate resolution, frame rate, color gamut, gamma, and white point performance in high-definition video work.
Professionally Factory-Calibrated for Exacting Color Accuracy
Each PD2500Q display is individually factory-calibrated upon production to assure precise Delta-E and Gamma performance. Calibration results are validated against industry color standards to deliver the truest and most representative view of original content. Calibration eliminates slight color performance variations between individual panels of the same model. Therefore, the calibration data of each report will vary slightly from reports from other displays of the same model.
Technicolor Color Certified
Technicolor Color Certification meets strict color standards widely used in Hollywood and entertainment industries. All BenQ PD Series Designer Monitors are Technicolor Color Certified, ensuring consistent and accurate colors for impressive performance in broadcast, film, animation, and entertainment applications.
Smart Efficiency and Productivity Enhancers

Edge-to-Edge Design and Universal Connectivity
Eliminating bulky obstructions with a 25"" edge-to-edge panel and ultra slim bezels, PD2500Q maximizes your workspace for seamless dual-monitor usage via DisplayPort daisy chaining with multi-stream transport (MST) support to extend your notebook screen across several displays. Multiple HDMI, DisplayPort, mini DisplayPort, USB 3.1 Gen1, headphone, and audio ports make PD2500Q ideal for any Windows, Mac, or mobile source devices.
Specialized Designer Modes
Offering superior contrast for lines and shapes in technical illustrations, CAD/CAM mode accentuates the finest details to produce incredible display performance in Pro/E, SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, CATIA, or other design software.
Adjusting image brightness and contrast for superb clarity and detail sharpness, Darkroom mode creates the optimal setting for work in darkened post-processing environments.
Often problematic for designers working with intricate details in dark images, Animation mode enhances the brightness of dark areas without overexposing bright regions. Animation mode provides 10 levels of display brightness to bring out every subtlety clearly in any ambient lighting.
Simply Intuitive Design for Comfortable Creative Process

Anti-Glare Display to Minimize Distracting Reflections
PD2500Q's anti-glare matte finish keeps distracting reflections to a minimum for improved efficiency in squint-free comfort.

Precise Details to Create Perfection
Design professionals never compromise on details. BenQ Designer Monitors deliver absolute color precision and ultra detailed high resolution to craft every step leading to brilliant work, turning design dreams into reality.
Stunning Color and Resolution for Breathtaking Designs

2K QHD High Resolution
2K QHD (2560x1440) resolution offers extraordinary clarity of fine details and depth of subtle textures optimized for visually intensive work in animation, visual effects, graphics, and photos.
Reference-Grade Color Performance with 100% sRGB and Rec. 709
Covering 100% of sRGB and Rec. 709 color spaces, PD2500Q's advanced IPS wide viewing angle technology minimizes color shift to inspire absolute design confidence. 100% sRGB color gamut accuracy adheres to industry standards in digital production, and Rec. 709 reproduces accurate resolution, frame rate, color gamut, gamma, and white point performance in high-definition video work.
Professionally Factory-Calibrated for Exacting Color Accuracy
Each PD2500Q display is individually factory-calibrated upon production to assure precise Delta-E and Gamma performance. Calibration results are validated against industry color standards to deliver the truest and most representative view of original content. Calibration eliminates slight color performance variations between individual panels of the same model. Therefore, the calibration data of each report will vary slightly from reports from other displays of the same model.
Technicolor Color Certified
Technicolor Color Certification meets strict color standards widely used in Hollywood and entertainment industries. All BenQ PD Series Designer Monitors are Technicolor Color Certified, ensuring consistent and accurate colors for impressive performance in broadcast, film, animation, and entertainment applications.
Smart Efficiency and Productivity Enhancers

Edge-to-Edge Design and Universal Connectivity
Eliminating bulky obstructions with a 25"" edge-to-edge panel and ultra slim bezels, PD2500Q maximizes your workspace for seamless dual-monitor usage via DisplayPort daisy chaining with multi-stream transport (MST) support to extend your notebook screen across several displays. Multiple HDMI, DisplayPort, mini DisplayPort, USB 3.1 Gen1, headphone, and audio ports make PD2500Q ideal for any Windows, Mac, or mobile source devices.
Specialized Designer Modes
Offering superior contrast for lines and shapes in technical illustrations, CAD/CAM mode accentuates the finest details to produce incredible display performance in Pro/E, SOLIDWORKS, AutoCAD, CATIA, or other design software.
Adjusting image brightness and contrast for superb clarity and detail sharpness, Darkroom mode creates the optimal setting for work in darkened post-processing environments.
Often problematic for designers working with intricate details in dark images, Animation mode enhances the brightness of dark areas without overexposing bright regions. Animation mode provides 10 levels of display brightness to bring out every subtlety clearly in any ambient lighting.
Simply Intuitive Design for Comfortable Creative Process

Anti-Glare Display to Minimize Distracting Reflections
PD2500Q's anti-glare matte finish keeps distracting reflections to a minimum for improved efficiency in squint-free comfort.

Eizo,,Displays,CG319X-4K-BK,6.90592E+11,5789.69,6,"EIZO ColorEdge CG319X 31.1"" 4K LCD Monitor - 17:9 - Black - 4096 x 2160 - 350 Nit Typical - 9 ms GTG - HDMI - DisplayPort COLOREDGE CG319-4K-BK FLEX STND
HDR video editing and color-accurate photo display in 4K resolution for creating a truly immersive experience.
A professional 4096 x 2160 monitor equipped with HLG and the PQ gamma curve for editing HDR video content, as well as a wide color gamut for displaying vibrant images.
Built-In Sensor to Automate Your Workflow
The ColorEdge CG319X is equipped with a built-in sensor which can be set to calibrate the monitor automatically at designated times. This eliminates the need for a third-party calibration device and ensures your screen stays color-accurate. In addition, the monitor features the latest sensor technology, which allows you to continue using it even during recalibration. The sensor swings onto the screen, taking up minimal space, so your work remains uninterrupted.
ColorNavigator 6 Color Management Software
To properly manage color in your work, it is necessary to ensure your monitor maintains consistent settings. ColorNavigator 6 is available as a free download and allows you to easily carry out calibration. Simply select the desired preset or assign values for brightness, white point, and gamma. The built-in sensor directly utilizes the monitor's look-up-table and creates an ICC profile within minutes.
ColorNavigator NX Quality Control Software
The CG319X supports ColorNavigator NX quality control (QC) software. It offers asset management of client ColorEdge monitors and covers calibration, emulation, built-in sensor correlation, and color mode settings. With ColorNavigator NX, calibration information is saved to the monitor instead of the PC's operating system so you do not have to recalibrate if connecting to more than one PC. The software is most effectively used with EIZO's ColorNavigator Network solution.
ColorNavigator Network Quality Control Software
ColorNavigator Network provides centralized quality control of ColorEdge monitors that have ColorNavigator NX installed. Administrators can set color modes, schedule self-calibration, register or adjust asset management settings, and other tasks whether the monitors are local or remote. ColorNavigator Network is hosted on a secure cloud server to free you from the initial investment and running costs of providing your own server.

Predictable Color with Any Media
With content published on so many different types of printed and digital media it's critical to know how your clients will see color. A ColorEdge monitor and the bundled ColorNavigator software let you do just that as they are designed for both softproofing and digital device emulation. So now you can ""predict"" how color will appear to your clients whether you produce content for printed media like books and magazines or for digital media devices like tablets, smart phones, and notebook computers.

DCI 4K Resolution

The ColorEdge CG319X displays the DCI 4K standard (4096 x 2160) which is more than four times that of full HD (1920 x 1080). It's ideal for creating, editing, and referencing with 2D and 3D CGI, VFX, compositing, and color grading.
Large 31.1"" Screen
Whether you are creating, editing, or checking your work, this screen offers ample space to focus on 4K content. At a dense 149 ppi, it's suited for not only video editing but also photo retouching and printing.

Relive the Moment
With Adobe RGB wide color space
Devoted to meet the latest professional color standard, BenQ has developed AQCOLOR technology to uphold the concept: ""Accurate Reproduction"". BenQ has invited a color expert to lead the team, and also actively participated in ICC (International Color Consortium) and ISO (International Standard Organization) to establish color-related standards and implementation.
99% Adobe RGB
See the true colors of nature! Adobe RGB color space offers a greater range of color reproduction for shades of blue and green, resulting in a more realistic color representation for outdoor and nature photography.
10-bit Color Display
Enjoy the smoothest color gradations on a 10-bit display which shows more than one billion colors.
14-Bit 3D LUT and Delta E ≤ 2
The 14-bit 3D Look Up Table (LUT) improves RGB color blending accuracy, resulting in impeccable color reproduction. Having Delta E≤2 in both Adobe RGB and sRGB color spaces gives you the truest and most representative view of the original image.
Hardware Calibration
Hardware calibration allows you to adjust the image processing chip in the monitor without changing the graphics card output data. It keeps images consistent with its original copies without being affected by graphic settings.
Palette Master Element Calibration Software
With the use of Palette Master Element and a calibrator, you can tune and maintain the color performance of the monitor at its most optimal state.
Extra Space for Viewing Convenience
Enjoy the extra space offered by the SW240's 24.1"" 1920x1200 screen size with 16:10 ratio - perfect for professional photographers, or just daily usage. The SW240's slightly larger size is perfect for viewing two full A4 sized documents side by side, allowing photographers to compare the content at a glance.
Color Mode HotKey
The SW240's inbuilt Color Mode HotKey allows you to swiftly switch between 3 preset color modes without having to press other OSD buttons. And you can also customize your preferred preset modes based on your own personal display needs by pressing the HotKey for 5 seconds.
Advanced Black & White Mode
View your photos in a black and white film effect. Choose from three different black and white presets to preview your photos in before you perform actual adjustments in your photo processing program.
Shading Hood
A detachable shading hood is available as an optional accessory for SW240 which can effectively reduce the monitor's screen glare resulting from ambient lighting, ensuring superb color accuracy required for professional work. The shading hood can be used for both portrait and landscape orientations.
Industry-Leading Eye-Care Technology
BenQ exclusive eye-care technologies reduce eye fatigue for user comfort, enhanced productivity, and workplace safety during extended use.

Smooth transitions: Conveniently connect to a variety of laptops, or switch seamlessly between users, thanks to USB-C connectivity-ideal for shared workspaces.
Push your productivity
More room to work: With a thin profile and the smallest base in its classi, you can free up valuable desk space.

Expand your efficiency: The three-sided ultrathin bezel design lets you enjoy an uninterrupted view of your content across multiple monitors. And, with dual monitors, you can increase your productivity by up to 18%i.

More ways to multitask: Work conveniently across multiple screens and select from predefined templates with the Easy Arrange feature on Dell Display Manager software. Quickly tile and arrange your applications and get back to work faster with Auto-restore, a feature that remembers where you left off.

Consistent and rich colors: A wide viewing angle enabled by In-plane switching technology lets you see vibrant colors-no matter where you sit.
Designed to fit the way you work
Clean and clutter-free: Focus on your work while hiding away cable clutter with an improved cable management design.

Easy on the eyes: This TUVi Certified monitor has a flicker-free screen with ComfortView, a feature that reduces harmful blue light emissions. It's designed to optimize eye comfort even over extended viewing.

Adjust to your comfort: Pivot, tilt, swivel and adjust the height of your monitor for a comfortable setup all day long. Or choose from a variety of mounts and stands, including VESA, for even more flexibility.

Features
A TV built for your business
Do more with your TV
Communicate with your customers without the need for physical paper materials. The simple, ready-to-use Business TV app allows you to showcase advertising content alongside TV programming.
Eye-catching content for your business
Deliver a brilliant visual experience with UHD displays in a range of sizes to fit any space or budget. Featuring an impressive warrantee, Business TVs are built to operate even with extended daily business hours, 16-hours a day, 7 days a week.
Control content with your personal device
The Samsung Business TV app, available for Android and iOS devices, provides additional convenience by allowing users to remotely manage and control content on connected Business TVs.
Simple setup in minutes
Set up could not be easier. Samsung's Business TV comes preloaded with a step-by-step tutorial that automatically begins when users first turn the TV on. After downloading the business TV app, users' devices are automatically connected to the TV and available for immediate use.
Design content with the click of a button
Support more than 100 pre-loaded templates including L-Bar layouts, motion-embedded, seasonal sale and other pre-designed promotions for do-it-yourself content creation.
Easy content management
An incredibly simple interface allows you to edit, review, finalize and deploy content - even across multiple displays - with just a few quick taps.
Focus on your business, not your TV
Spend less time dealing with technical issues. An on/off timer allows the TV to automatically operate during business hours and a pin-code protects the display settings, avoiding any potential content interruptions.

Comprehensive connectivity, maximum productivity
Connect to productivity: Experience outstanding wired connection to your network. With extensive connectivity options like RJ45 and USB-C, your monitor serves as a productivity hub that delivers stable Ethernet and power - all in a clutter-free setup.

Enhanced manageability: Managing your monitor is easy with MAC Address pass-through, PXE Boot, and Wake-on-LAN conveniently built in.

Power of USB-C: Charge your connected laptop with up to 65W of power using USB-C, a single cable solution that transmits power, data and video signals. And with the Always On Power Delivery feature, your laptop will keep charging, even when the monitor is turned off. USB-C also saves up to 72% of workspace setup time, reduces cable clutter and enables quick transitions from your desk.

Setup is a snap: Experience a convenient multi-monitor setup with Dell Express Daisy Chaining. It allows automatic detection of the second display, skipping the manual step of changing OSD settings.
Outstanding visuals
Essential screen performance: Experience clarity and detail with Full HD (1920x1080) resolution on a 23.8"" screen.

Color consistency comes standard: Your UltraSharp monitor is factory calibrated at 99% sRGB coverage to an accuracy of Delta-E less than 2, for precise hues right out of the box. Plus with 85% coverage of the DCI-P3 color space, you will see images and video in an even wider range of colors.

Always the best view: See consistent, vibrant colors across a wide viewing angle enabled by In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology.
Innovative design
Free up valuable desk space: Optimize your workspace with a stylish monitor featuring a thin panel profile, a compact base, and a cable management slot that can hide cable cutter from view. Plus the conveniently placed USB downstream ports (one featuring power charging) gives you easy access to what you need.

Expand your efficiency: The virtually borderless InfinityEdge design lets you enjoy a seamless view of your content across multiple monitors. And, with dual monitors, you can increase your productivity by up to 21%.

Adjust to your comfort: Pivot, tilt, swivel and adjust the height of your monitor for a comfortable setup all day long. Our improved design, with the hinge on the riser, makes it easier to adjust while keeping the riser in the same place.

Easy on the eyes: This TUV Certified monitor has a flicker-free screen with ComfortView, a feature that reduces harmful blue light emissions. It's designed to optimize eye comfort even over an extended period of time.

R1 displays have an ultra-thin enclosure with most of the display being only 6.6 mm thick, thinner than many smartphones. In addition, the ""ZeroFrame"" design maximises the view and minimises visual clutter with a bezel so thin that you barely notice it.
Our R1 displays are designed to help preserve eye health. Flicker-less design reduces eye strain from screen flicker. A Blue Light Filter reduces the negative effects of excess blue spectrum exposure, and our ComfyView reduces screen reflection.

More productive by design
Adapts to any routine: Make your monitor your own with the height adjustable stand. Raise the stand or tilt the display for improved comfort and ergonomics.

Amplify your work: Lose the sounds of your surroundings and focus on incoming notifications with the new integrated speakers.

A flexible setup: Customize your workspace with VESA-compatible mounts and stands.
Improved Dell Display Manager
Productive at every level: Dell Display Manager's (DDM) Easy Arrange feature lets you quickly tile and view your applications side by side across one or more connected screens for multitasking efficiency. And with the improved DDM, you'll get even more preset layouts.

Seamless transitions: The auto-restore feature remembers where you left off, so applications will go back to where you left them, even after you've unplugged.

The key to convenience: Shortcut keys can save you even more time, letting you easily configure your display management settings so you can get to work faster.

More ways to manage: Asset management reports allow IT managers to quickly capture and track monitor information as well as configure multiple monitors at once through a single setup.
Necessities that go beyond basic
Work with a view: Your work will shine from any angle on this 27-inch display. Full HD resolution with In-Plane Switching (IPS) technology delivers consistent colors across the screen.

Maximize your space: A thin profile, narrow bezel and improved cable management create a small footprint in a wide view, lending itself to a clean, uncluttered desk.

Versatile connections: Our E Series monitors accommodate legacy and non-legacy systems with convenient connectivity options like VGA and DP ports. Your workspace will be completely customized to your needs.

Ready for long days: ComfortView reduces up to 60% of harmful blue light emissions for extended viewing periods.
Eco-friendly inside and out
Guaranteed green: Compliant with the latest Energy Star® standards, the E Series monitors meet stringent energy efficiency requirements while in sleep, on and off modes. They're also EPEAT® registered and TCO-certified.

Energy reducing: Save energy with PowerNap, a feature that dims or puts the monitor to sleep when not in use.

Clean disposal: Composting or recycling the packaging is easy since it's made with at least 25% of recycled cardboard.

Asus,,Displays,MB169B+,8.86228E+11,164.27,11,"Asus MB169B+ 15.6"" Full HD LED LCD Monitor - 16:9 - Silver, Black - 1920 x 1080 - 200 Nit - 14 ms MB169B+ USB3 14MS
Two Screens Are Better Than One
One Cable Does the Job
15.6-inch Full HD display with a single USB 3.0 cable for power and data transmission
Sleek and Ultra-portable
World's slimmest and lightest USB monitors with a metallic finish
Adjusting to Your Needs
Auto-rotating display bundled with the ASUS Smart Case - a two-way adjustable stand and protective sleeve
One cable does the job, adding a second monitor has never been so easy
The 15.6-inch MB169B+ portable USB-powered monitor needs just one USB cable for both its video signal and power to deliver up to a Full HD resolution. Thanks to the higher bandwidth of USB 3.0, experience fast, fluid images from your connected device that makes having an on-the-go multi-display setup a reality. What's more, the MB169B+ is backwards compatible with a notebook or desktop PC USB 2.0 port.
Sleek and ultra-portable with a Zen-inspired design
With a slim 8.5 mm (0.3-inch) profile and tipping the scales at just 800g (1.76 pounds), the MB169B+ is the world's slimmest and lightest companion display, ideal for a simple on-the-go dual-monitor setup and mobile presentations.
A durable metallic finish with a fine pattern of concentric circles makes the MB169B+ the perfect complement to your notebook. And for added durability, it comes with a protective carrying case that doubles as an adjustable stand for tabletop use.
Adjusting to your needs
The MB169B+ with Auto Rotate (patent-pending) can automatically sense its orientation and switches the display between landscape and portrait based on its position; also, featuring IPS panel ensures a better viewing angle and nearly no color shift promise. These features provide you a more user-friendly scenario.
Increased productivity with ASUS EzLink technology
The MB169B+ features ASUS EzLink technology that offloads graphics processing from the PC to dedicated hardware in the monitor. As a result, a PC can drive up to five MB169B+ monitors at the same time, regardless of its own graphics capability - it just needs sufficient USB ports. EzLink also automatically restores application window positions as a MB169B+ monitor is connected and disconnected, and automatically rotates the image between landscape and portrait modes, as required.
